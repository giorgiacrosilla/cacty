	</h2>
	</br>
	Sometime in the early <span class="date-1800">1830s</span>, a <span class="organization Yale"><a

		class="place Germany"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</a></span></span> to study for a
	year. <span class="person William-H-Russel"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Russell">Russell</a></span></span>
	came from an inordinately wealthy family that ran one of <span class="place state America"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America’s</a></span></span> most despicable
	business organizations of the nineteenth century: <span class="organization"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_%26_Company">Russell and Company</a></span>, an opium
	empire. <span class="person William-H-Russel"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Russell">William

		class="person William-H-Russel"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Russell">William

	of an insidious German secret society that hailed the death’s head as its logo. <span
		class="person William-H-Russel"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Russell">William

	honor society, had been unceremoniously stripped of its secrecy. Incensed, <span class="person William-H-Russel"><a

	rounded up a group of the most promising students in his class-including <span class="person Alphonso-Taft"><a

	</br>
	<span class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale’s</a></span></span></span> secret society
	exposed
	</br>
	<span class="date">September 4, 2002</span> — Journalist and author <span class="person Alexandra-Robbins"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Robbins">Alexandra Robbins</a></span></span> discusses her
	book
	“Secrets of the Tomb: <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span>, the Ivy League, and
	the Hidden Paths of
	Power” with “Today’s” Ann Curry.
	</br>
	The men called their organization the Brotherhood of Death, or, more informally, the
	Order of <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull
			and Bones</a></span></span>. They adopted the numerological symbol 322 because their
	group was the second chapter of the German organization and founded in <span class="date-1800">1832</span>. They
	worshiped the goddess Eulogia, celebrated pirates, and plotted an underground
	conspiracy to dominate the world.
	</br>
	Fast-forward 170 years. <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> has curled its
	tentacles into every corner of
	American society. This tiny club has set up networks that have thrust three members
	into the most powerful political position in the world. And the group’s influence is
	only increasing-the <span class="date">2004 <span class="event"><a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election">presidential
				election</a></span></span> might showcase the first time each
	ticket has been led by a Bonesman. The secret society is now, as one historian
	admonishes, ” ‘an international mafia’. . . unregulated and all but unknown.” In its
	quest to create a New World Order that restricts individual freedoms and places
	ultimate power solely in the hands of a small cult of wealthy, prominent families,
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> has already succeeded in infiltrating nearly every major research,
	policy, financial, media, and government institution in the country. <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span>,
	in fact, has been running the <span class="America"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United
			States</a></span> for years.
	</br>
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> cultivates its talent by selecting members from the junior class at
	<span class="organization Yale"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale
			University</a></span></span>, a school known for its strange, Gothic elitism and its rigid devotion
	to the past. The society screens its candidates carefully, favoring Protestants and, now,
	white Catholics, with special affection for the children of wealthy East Coast Skull
	and Bones members. <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> has been dominated by
	about two dozen of the
	country’s most prominent families—<span class="person"><span class="Bush"><a
				href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush">Bush</a></span></span>, <span
		class="person Bundy">Bundy</span></span>, <span class="person Harriman">Harriman</span></span>, <span
		class="person Lord">Lord</span></span>, <span class="person Phelps">Phelps</span></span>,
	<span class="person"><span class="Rockefeller">Rockefeller</span></span>, <span
		class="person Taft">Taft</span></span>, and <span class="person Whitney"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_family">Whitney</a></span></span> among them—who are encouraged
	by the society to
	intermarry so that its power is consolidated. In fact, <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> forces members
	to confess their entire sexual histories so that the club, as a eugenics overlord, can
	determine whether a new Bonesman will be fit to mingle with the bloodlines of the
	powerful <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull
			and Bones</a></span></span> dynasties. A rebel will not make <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span>; nor will
	anyone whose background in any way indicates that he will not sacrifice for the
	greater good of the larger organization.
	</br>
	As soon as initiates are allowed into the “tomb,” a dark, windowless crypt in <span class="New-Haven">New
		Haven</span> with a roof that serves as a landing pad for the society’s private helicopter,
	they are sworn to silenceand told they must forever deny that they are members of this
	organization. During initiation, which involves ritualistic psychological conditioning,
	the juniors wrestle in mud and are physically beaten—this stage of the ceremony
	represents their “death” to the world as they have known it. They then lie naked in
	coffins, masturbate, and reveal to the society their innermost sexual secrets. After this
	cleansing, the Bonesmen give the initiates robes to represent their new identities as
	individuals with a higher purpose. The society anoints the initiate with a new name,
	symbolizing his rebirth and rechristening as Knight X, a member of the Order. It is
	during this initiation that the new members are introduced to the artifacts in the tomb,
	among them Nazi memorabilia—including a set of <span class="person Hitler"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">Hitler’s</a></span></span> silverware-dozens of
	skulls, and an assortment of decorative tchotchkes: coffins, skeletons, and innards.
	They are also introduced to “the Bones whore,” the tomb’s only full-time resident,
	who helps to ensure that the Bonesmen leave the tomb more mature than when they
	entered.
	</br>
	Members of <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull
			and Bones</a></span></span> must make some sacrifices to the society—and they are
	threatened with blackmail so that they remain loyal—but they are remunerated with
	honors and rewards, including a graduation gift of $15,000 and a wedding gift of a tall
	grandfather clock. Though they must tithe their estates to the society, each member
	</br>
	is guaranteed financial security for life; in this way, Bones can ensure that no member
	will feel the need to sell the secrets of the society in order to make a living. And it
	works: No one has publicly breathed a word about his <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> membership,
	ever.
	</br>
	Bonesmen are automatically offered jobs at the many investment banks and law firms
	dominated by their secret society brothers. They are also given exclusive access to the
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> island, a lush retreat built for millionaires, with a lavish mansion and
	a bevy of women at the members’ disposal.
	</br>
	The influence of the cabal begins at <span class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale</a></span></span></span>, where <span
		class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> has appropriated
	university funds for its own use, leaving the school virtually impoverished. Skull and
	Bones’ corporate shell, the <span class="organization"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Trust_Association">Russell Trust Association</a></span>, owns
	nearly all of the
	university’s real estate, as well as most of the land in <span state class="place Connecticut"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut">Connecticut</a></span></span>. <span
		class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span>
	has controlled <span class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale’s</a></span></span></span> faculty and campus
	publications so that students cannot speak
	openly about it. “Year by year,” the campus’s only anti-society publication stated
	during its brief tenure in 1873, “the deadly evil is growing.”
	</br>
	The year in the tomb at <span class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale</a></span></span></span> instills within
	members an unwavering loyalty to Skull
	and Bones. Members have been known to stab their <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> pins into their
	skin to keep them in place during swimming or bathing. The knights (as the student
	members are called) learn quickly that their allegiance to the society must supersede
	all else: family, friendships, country, God. They are taught that once they get out into
	the world, they are expected to reach positions of prominence so that they can further
	elevate the society’s status and help promote the standing of their fellow Bonesmen.
	</br>
	This purpose has driven Bonesmen to ascend to the top levels of so many fields that,
	as one historian observes, “at any one time The Order can call on members in any
	area of American society to do what has to be done.” Several Bonesmen have been
	<span class="role">senators</span>, <span class="role">congressmen</span>, <span class="role">Supreme Court
		justices</span>, and <span class="role">Cabinet officials</span>. There is a
	Bones cell in the CIA, which uses the society as a recruiting ground because the
	members are so obviously adept at keeping secrets. Society members dominate
	financial institutions such as <span class="organization"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase">J.
			P. Morgan</a></span>, <span class="organization"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Witter_Reynolds">Morgan Stanley Dean Witter</a></span>, and <span
		class="organization"><a href="https://www.bbh.com/global/en.html">Brown
			Brothers Harriman</a></span>, where at one time more than a third of the partners were
	Bonesmen. Through these companies, <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> provided financial
	backing to
	<span class="person Hitler"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a></span></span>
	because the society then followed a Nazi-and now follows a neo-Nazi—
	doctrine. At least a dozen Bonesmen have been linked to the <span class="organization">Federal Reserve</span>,
	including the first chairman of the <span class="place state New-York"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York </a><span class="organization">Federal
			Reserve</span></span></span>. <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span>
	members control the wealth of the <span class="person"><span class="Rockefeller">Rockefeller</span></span>, <span
		class="person Carnegie"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie">Carnegie</a></span>, and <span
		class="person Ford"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford">Ford</a></span> families.
	</br>
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> has also taken steps to control the American media.

	Two of its members founded the law firm that represents the <span class="organization new-york-times">a
		href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></span></span>. Plans
	for both <span class="organization">Time</span> and <span class="organization">Newsweek</span> magazines were
	hatched in the <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> tomb.
	The society has controlled publishing houses such as <span class="organization">Farrar</span>, <span
		class="organization">Straus & Giroux</span>. In the
	<span class="date">1880s</span>, <span class="Skull-and-Bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones"><span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
					href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span></a></span>
	created the <span class="organization">American Historical Association</span>, <span class="organization">the
		American
		Psychological Association</span>, and the <span class="organization">American Economic Association</span> so
	that the
	society could ensure that history would be written under its terms and promote its
	objectives. The society then installed its own members as the presidents of these
	associations.
	</br>
	Under the society’s direction, Bonesmen developed and dropped the nuclear bomb
	and choreographed the <span class="event"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion">Bay of Pigs
			invasion</a></span>. <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> members had ties to
	<span class="event">Watergate</span> and the <span class="event"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassinio_di_John_Fitzgerald_Kennedy">Kennedy assassination</a></span>.
	They control the <span class="organization">Council on Foreign
		Relations</span> and the <span class="organization">Trilateral Commission</span> so that they can push their own
	political
	agenda. <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> government officials have used the number 322 as codes for
	highly classified diplomatic assignments. The society discriminates against minorities
	and fought for slavery; indeed eight out of twelve of <span class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale’s</a></span></span></span> residential
	colleges are
	named for slave owners while none are named for abolitionists. The society
	encourages misogyny: it did not admit women until the <span class="date-1900">1990s</span> because members did
	not believe women were capable of handling the <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> experience and
	because they said they feared incidents of date rape. This society also encourages
	grave robbing: deep within the bowels of the tomb are the stolen skulls of the Apache
	chief <span class="person Geronimo"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geronimo">Geronimo</a></span></span>,
	<span class="person Pancho-Villa">a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa">Pancho
		Villa</a></span></span>, and former <span class="role">president<span class="person Martin-Van-Buren"><a
				href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"> Martin Van Buren</a></span></span></span>.
	</br>
	Finally, the society has taken measures to ensure that the secrets of <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span>
	slip ungraspable like sand through open fingers. <span class="role">Journalist <span
			class=" person Ron-Rosenbaum"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rosenbaum">Ron
				Rosenbaum</a></span></span>, who
	wrote a long but not probing article about the society in the <span class="date-1900">1970s</span>, claimed that a
	source warned him not to get too close.

	“What bank do you have your checking account at?” this party asked me in the
	middle of a discussion of the Mithraic aspects of the Bones ritual.

	I named the bank. “Aha,” said the party. “There are three Bonesmen on the board.
	You’ll never have a line of credit again.

	They’ll tap your phone. They’ll. . . ” . . .The source continued: “The alumni still care.
	Don’t laugh. They don’t like people tampering and prying. The power of Bones is
	incredible. They’ve got their hands on every lever of power in the country. You’ll
	see—it’s like trying to look into the Mafia.”
	</br>
	In the <span class="date-1900">1980s</span>, a man known only as Steve had contracts to write two books on the
	society, using documents and photographs he had acquired from the Bones crypt. But
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> found out about Steve. Society members broke into his apartment,
	stole the documents, harassed the would-be author, and scared him into hiding, where
	he has remained ever since. The books were never completed. In Universal Pictures’
	thriller The Skulls (2000), an aspiring journalist is writing a profile of the society for
	the <span class="organization"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></span>. When he sneaks into the
	tomb, the Skulls murder him.
	</br>
	The real <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull
			and Bones</a></span></span> tomb displays a bloody knife in a glass case. It is said that
	when a Bonesman stole documents and threatened to publish society secrets if the
	members did not pay him a determined amount of money, they used that knife to kill
	him.
	</br>
	This, then, is the legend of <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span>. It is astonishing
	that so many people
	continue to believe, even in twenty-first-century <span class="place state America"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">America</a></span></span>that a tiny college club
	wields such an enormous amount of influence on the world’s only superpower. The
	breadth of clout ascribed to this organization is practically as wide-ranging as the
	leverage of the satirical secret society the Stonecutters introduced in an episode of
	The Simpsons. The Stonecutters theme song included the lyrics:
	</br>
	Who controls the British crown?
	Who keeps the metric system down? We do! We do. . .

	Who holds back the electric car?
	Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star? We do! We do.
	</br>
	Certainly, <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull
			and Bones</a></span></span> does cross boundaries in order to attempt to stay out of the
	public spotlight. When I wrote an article about the society for the <span class="organization">Atlantic
		Monthly</span> in
	<span class="date">May 2000</span>, an older Bonesman said to me, “If it’s not portrayed positively, I’m
	sending a couple of my friends after you.” After the article was published, I received a
	telephone call at my office from a fellow journalist, who is a member of Skull and
	Bones.
	</br>
	He scolded me for writing the article—”writing that article was not an ethical or
	honorable way to make a decent living in journalism,” he condescended —and then
	asked me how much I had been paid for the story.

	When I refused to answer, he hung up. Fifteen minutes later, he called back.

	“I have just gotten off the phone with our people.” “Your people?” I snickered.

	“Yes. Our people.” He told me that the society demanded to know where I got my
	information.

	“I’ve never been in the tomb and I did nothing illegal in the process of reporting this
	article,” I replied.

	“Then you must have gotten something from one of us. Tell me whom you spoke to.
	We just want to talk to them,” he wheedled. “I don’t reveal my sources.”
	</br>
	Then he got angry. He screamed at me for a while about how dishonorable I was for
	writing the article. “A lot of people are very despondent over this!” he yelled. “Fifteen
	<span class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale</a></span></span></span> juniors are very,
	very upset!” I thanked him for telling me his concerns.

	“There are a lot of us at newspapers and at political journalism institutions,” he coldly
	hissed. “Good luck with your career”—and he slammed down the phone.
	</br>
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span>, particularly in recent years, has managed to pervade both popular
	and political culture. In the <span class="date-1900">1992</span> race for the Republican presidential nomination,
	<span class="person Pat-Buchanan"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Buchanan">Pat
			Buchanan</a></span></span> accused <span class="role">President <span class="person George-Bush"><a
				href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George Bush</a></span></span></span> of running “a
	<span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> presidency.”
	</br>
	In <span class="date-1900">1993</span>, during <span class="person Jeb-Bush"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeb_Bush">Jeb Bush’s</a></span> <span class="place state Florida"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida">Florida</a></span> <span class="role">gubernatorial
		campaign</span>, one of his constituents
	asked him, “You’re familiar with the Skull and Crossbones Society?” When <span class="George-Bush"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush"> Bush</a></span>
	responded, “Yeah, I’ve heard about it,” the constituent persisted, “Well, can you tell
	the people here what your family membership in that is? Isn’t your aim to take control
	of the United States?” In <span class="date">January 2001</span>, <span class="organization"><a
			href="https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></span><span class="role">columnist</span> <span
		class="cited-authors Maureen-Dowd"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/maureen-dowd">Maureen Dowd</a></span>
	used <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
			Bones</a></span></span> in a simile: “When <span class="person">W.</span> met the press with his choice for
	attorney general, <span class="person John-Ashcroft"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ashcroft">John
			Ashcroft</a></span></span>, before Christmas, he vividly showed how important
	it is to him that his White House be as leak-proof as the <span class="Skull-and-Bones">Skull & Bones</span>
	‘tomb.’”
	</br>
	That was less than a year after the <span class="organization">Universal Pictures</span> film introduced the secret
	society to a new demographic perhaps uninitiated into the doctrines of modern-day
	conspiracy theory. Not long before the movie was previewed in theaters—and perhaps
	in anticipation of the <span class="event"><a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election">election of </a><span
			class="person George-Bush"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George
				Bush</a></span></span></span>—a letter was distributed to
	members from <span class="Skull-and-Bones"><span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
				href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span></span>
	headquarters. “In view of the political happenings in
	the barbarian world,” the memo read, “I feel compelled to remind all of the tradition
	of privacy and confidentiality essential to the well-being of our Order and strongly
	urge stout resistance to the seductions and blandishments of the Fourth Estate.” This
	vow of silence remains the society’s most important rule. Bonesmen have been
	exceedingly careful not to break this code of secrecy, and have kept specific details
	about the organization out of the press. Indeed, given the unusual, strict written
	reminder to stay silent, members of <span class="Skull-and-Bones"><span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
				href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span></span> may well
	refuse to speak to any
	member of the media ever again.
	</br>
	But they have already spoken to me. When? Over the past three years. Why? Perhaps
	because I am a member of one of <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span>’</span> kindred <span
		class="organization Yale"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A0_Yale">Yale</a></span></span></span> secret societies.
	Perhaps because some of them are tired of the <span class="Skull-and-Bones"><span
			class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and
				Bones</a></span></span></span> legend, of the claims
	of conspiracy theorists and some of their fellow Bonesmen. What follows, then, is the
	truth about <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull
			and Bones</a></span></span></span>. And if this truth does not contain all of the conspiratorial
	elements that the <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> legend projects, it
	is perhaps all the more
	interesting for that fact. The story of <span class="organization skull-and-bones"><a
			href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones">Skull and Bones</a></span></span> is not just the story
	of a
	remarkable secret society, but a remarkable society of secrets, some with basis in
	truth, some nothing but fog. Much of the way we understand the world of power
	involves myriad assumptions of connection and control, of cause and effect, and of
	coincidence that surely cannot be coincidence.
