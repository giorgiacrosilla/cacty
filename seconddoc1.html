        bequeath his vast fortune to the founding of a university and a</lb>
        hospital that would eventually bear his name. Th e legal documents creating these two institutions were drawn up
        in <span class="date-1800">1867</span>,</lb>
        6 years before <span class="person john-hopkins"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins">
                Hopkins</a></span></span> death. He carefully chose 12 trustees</lb>
        for each institution, nine of whom overlapped, to serve on the</lb>
        hospital and university boards. Th e hospital board busied itself</lb>
        with the acquisition of the land on which the hospital would</lb>
        eventually be built in <span class="date-1800">1889</span>, but the university board was necessarily idle until
        their benefactor’s death, when it would receive</lb>
        its inheritance.</lb>
        <span class="person john-hopkins"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins">Johns
                Hopkins</a></span></span> died on <span class="date-1800">Christmas Eve, 1873</span>, in his 78th</lb>
        year. Within months of his death, the university board took</lb>
        in earnest their charge of developing a university. They requested advice from three eminent educators: <span
            class="role">President</span> <span class="person">Eliot</span></lb>
        of <span class="organization"><a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a></span>, <span

                    White</a></span> of <span class="organization cornell"><a
                    href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a></span></span></span>. The advice they received was, in
        </lb>
        retrospect, rather pedestrian and plebian; what the eminent</lb>

        vision. Th e consultant’s major service, however, came when</lb>
        each was asked, individually, for suggestions as to the future</lb>
        <span class="role">president</span> of <span class="organization john-hopkins-university"><a
                href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Hopkins</a></span></span>. Each one, without consultation with the</lb>

        Their trust was to be well rewarded over the next 25 years. For</lb>

        in this country. Th e result: a sterling collection of scholars who</lb>
        would make any university in the world proud (Table).</lb>
        It was this group of scholars, now largely forgotten, who forged</lb>
        the sterling reputation of the new <span class="organization john-hopkins-university"><a
                href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a></span> </span>and</lb>
        within the decade propelled it into the top rank of American</lb>
        schools. It is noteworthy that three of the six were 30 years or</lb>
        younger at the time of their appointment; this pattern would repeat</lb>
        itself 15 years later when the medical faculty was formed. In that</lb>
        instance, all four of the founding doctors were under age 40.</lb>
        On <span class="date-1800">February 22, 1876</span>, <span class="person"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span> delivered his inaugural
        address as <span class="role">president of <span class="organization john-hopkins-university"><a
                    href="https://www.jhu.edu/"> Johns Hopkins </a></span></span></span>. The date was chosen with</lb>
        care; it was the birthday of the nation’s first president, in the</lb>
        centennial year of the republic. At the time of this address,</lb>
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span> had not
        completed his faculty search and the first students would not appear for another 7 months. In a remarkable</lb>
        address, well worth pondering some 125 years later, <span class="person"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span></lb>
        laid out his vision for the new university:</lb>
        An enduring foundation; a slow development, first local, then</lb>
        regional, then national influence; the liberal promotion of all</lb>
        useful knowledge; the special provision of departments as are</lb>
        elsewhere neglected in this country; a generous affiliation with</lb>
        all other institutions, avoiding interferences and engaging in</lb>
        no rivalry; the encouragement of research; the promotion of</lb>
        young men; and the advancement of individual scholars, who</lb>
        by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and</lb>
        the society where they dwell.</lb>
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span> succeeded
        beyond his wildest dreams. <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman">
                Gilman</a></span> was</lb>
        the visionary, the encourager, the seeker of bright students and
    </div>
    </lb>
    <br>
    <div class="two-columns">faculty with fresh ideas. He encouraged the publication of the</lb>
        research results from the fledgling school, and at his backing</lb>
        the <span class="organization">Johns Hopkins Press</span> became the first publication agency of</lb>
        a university. It was established in <span class="date-1800">1878</span> to publish the <span
            class="organization">American</lb>
            Journal of Mathematics</span>; soon to follow were specialty journals</lb>
        in chemistry, philology, biology, history, and political science,</lb>
        all edited and supported by the <span class="organization">Hopkins faculty</span>. He built up</lb>
        the intellectual atmosphere of the school by inviting prominent</lb>
        men of learning to deliver public lectures at <span class="organization john-hopkins-university"><a
                href="https://www.jhu.edu/">The Johns Hopkins </a></span></span>, a common</lb>
        practice in our day but a bold innovation at the time.</lb>
        Some measure of his infl uence and importance in American</lb>
        education can be gleaned from the accolades accorded by his</lb>
        biographers:</lb>
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman's</a></span> greatest
        achievement, and the one with which his</lb>
        name will always be associated, was the introduction of the idea</lb>
        of a true university to <span class="place state America"><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stati_Uniti_d%27America">America</a></span></span>. It would be

        created the pattern of</lb>

        in which the discovery and dissemination of new truths were</lb>

        <br>
        Although <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman's</a></span>
        greatest fame rests with his <span class="role">presidency</lb>
            of The <span class="organization john-hopkins-university"><a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins
                    University</a></span></span></span>, he made significant contributions to the formation of <span
            class="organization">The Johns Hopkins Hospital</span> as</lb>
        well. As the date for the opening of the hospital approached,</lb>
        scheduled for <span class="date-1800">May 1889</span>, the trustees had not yet settled on</lb>
        a superintendent for the hospital, and they asked that <span class="person"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span> temporarily assume that
        position. He agreed to do so</lb>
        and for a time maintained two offi ces, one at the hospital</lb>
        where he spent his mornings and a second across town at</lb>
        the university.</lb>
        In typical <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span>
        style, he versed himself in the pertinent</lb>
        literature about hospital administration, corresponded with</lb>
        experts in the fi eld both here and abroad, and took it upon</lb>
        himself to visit large successful hospitals and hotels in this</lb>
        country, studying kitchens, linen supply, and the minutiae</lb>
        of laundry facilities. It was <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman">
                Gilman</a></span> who appointed the principal for the school of nursing and the head nurses for the
    </div>
    </lb>
    <br>
    <div class="two-columns">various departments. He suggested the publication of reports</lb>
        from the hospital, eventuating in the Bulletin of <span class="organization"><a
                href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the-johns-hopkins-hospital">The Johns</lb>
                Hopkins Hospital</a></span> and <span class="organization">The Johns Hopkins Hospital Reports</span>.
        </lb>
        His successor as head of the hospital, <span class="person henry-hurd"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mills_Hurd">Henry Hurd</a></span></span>, credited</lb>
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman</a></span> with
        establishing a simple but effective system of</lb>
        governance for the medical institutions, consisting of the</lb>
        heads of the various medical departments and the superintendent of the hospital, with <span
            class="role">President Gilman</span> presiding</lb>
        over the meetings.</lb>
        <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman's</a></span> involvement
        with the medical school was not</lb>
        perfunctory; it was real, it was vital to success, and it was continuously maintained. Indeed, his efforts
        constituted <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman"> Gilman's</a></span>
        </lb>
        second great contribution to the educational development of</lb>
        this country. <span class="abraham-flexner"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner">Flexner</a></span> summed it up as follows:</lb>
        No other educator, American or foreign, ever wrought such</lb>
        miracles as <span class="person"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman">
                Gilman</a></span>performed, first in the faculty of Arts and</lb>
        Sciences, and later in the medical school. Both were eminent</lb>
        from the start; both started a movement which revolutionized graduate education and research; had the university
        and</lb>
        its medical department never been started, or had they been</lb>
        otherwise started, university education and medical education</lb>
        in <span class="America"><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki>/Stati_Uniti_d%27America">America</a></span>
        would in all probability never have attained their</lb>
        present eminence.</lb>

        more interested in a career in teaching the classics</lb>
        than in medicine, but only one faculty position in the classics</lb>
        was available, and it went to an individual who finished ahead of</lb>
        <span class="william-henry-welch"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">Welch</a></span>
        scholastically. On such a slender thread hung the future</lb>
        of American medicine.</lb>
        <span class="william-henry-welch"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">Welch</a></span> was

            class="date-1800">1869–1870</span>. He</lb>
        wrote his father, “The honor is more agreeable to me than any</lb>
        other in college could have been.” Later, in writing to a relative</lb>
        whose son was considering another college, <span class="william-henry-welch"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">Welch</a></span> wrote: “If</lb>

            Bones</span> was important to <span class="william-henry-welch"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">Dr. Welch</a></span>.</lb>

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">Welch</a></span> reluctantly turned to medicine

        In <span class="date-1800">April 1876</span>, shortly after his graduation, <span class="william-henry-welch"><a

        contributions to surgery. Rather, he</lb>
        would have become a popular, socially prominent, extremely</lb>
