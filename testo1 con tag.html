	A half-century ago, some historians connected Freemasonry with <span class="event">American independence </span> because a few leaders of the Revolutionary generation—most notably <span class="person">Benjamin Franklin</span> and <span class="person">George Washington</span>—were Freemasons. <span class="person">Bernard Fay</span>, a French historian who exposed Masons to the Nazis in occupied <span class="place">France</span> during World War II, made emphatic claims for Freemasonry's importance to eighteenth-century revolutionary movements in France and the American colonies. Fay saw Freemasonry as the "main instigator of the intellectual revolution" of that age and "the spiritual father of its political revolutions." According to Fay, Freemasons engendered among "a limited but very prominent class of people a feeling of American unity without which American liberty could not have developed—without which there would have been no United States."1 Fay relied heavily on one Masonic writer in the United States, <span class="person">Sidney Morse</span>, for his conclusions about Revolutionary America. Morse was convinced that "Masonry brought together in secret and trustful conference the patriot leaders" who led their country in a "fight for freedom." Morse saw Freemasons everywhere he looked: they sank the revenue schooner <span class="place">Gaspee</span> in <span class="date">1772</span>; they orchestrated the <span class="event">Boston Tea Party</span> a year and a half later; and they dominated committees of correspondence, committees of safety, provincial conventions, and the Continental Congress. Based only on hearsay, Morse wrote that "<span class="person">Washington</span>, according to <span class="person">La Fayette</span>, it is said, never willingly gave independent command to officers who were not Freemasons." Morse followed in the footsteps of other patriotic Masons. For example, a zealous Masonic orator had eulogized Washington soon after his death: 
A single institution [Masonry] brought men to the level of equality; he wished to understand its principles, he wished to become one. its members. His soul have the pride to believe, [Masonic] temple of and on the improvements its members. His soul expanded with the pure flame of charity; and, I have the pride to believe, that, the first step which he made in the [Masonic] temple of truth, had an influence on the fate of this empire, and on the improvements in the systems of other governments.2

For years Masonic writers repeated the sentiments expressed by Washington's enthusiastic Masonic contemporary, albeit without any proof to substantiate their claims. Masonic lodges left skimpy records, and Masons rarely mentioned such ties in their correspondence. More vexing still for the historian, they virtually never linked their Masonic association to their political views. Forced into performing logical and stylistic gymnastics as a result, one later Mason wrote, "What influence Freemasonry may have had on the life and character of <span class="person">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</span> can only be conjecture, but that it did influence him and his contemporaries in the great struggle for American independence seems beyond doubt."3 Masonic enthusiasts and Fay notwithstanding, most historians have had little interest in the subject. <span class="person">Crane Brinton</span> tipped his hat to Masonic involvement in the <span class="event"> French Revolution</span> but had nothing to say about Freemasons and the American Revolution. <span class="person">R. R. Palmer</span> concluded that even in <span="place”>France</span>, Masons were politically "innocuous if not ridiculous" and did not act as a group. <span class="person">Bernard Bailyn</span> passed over Freemasons in Revolutionary America altogether. Recently several historians have done detailed studies of eighteenth-century Masonry, but they have assiduously avoided making a causal link between Masonry and the American Revolution.

The representations at the bottom are the Masonic altar, the casket and spade (death), the evergreen (immortality), and an allusion to the placement of Masonic lodges and heavenly bodies.

 Masonic writers themselves have become more circumspect. One succinctly stated, "all patriots were not Freemasons and all Freemasons were not patriots." Another studied 241 "Founding Fathers" and determined that only 68 were Masons, not all of them active members. Still another
 had been reluctant to write a new biography of George Washington, since he knew that Washington was not very involved in the Brotherhood. Thus, in a sense, the Masonic view and the opinions of professional historians have been reconciled.5

 The first official history of the Brotherhood was The Constitutions of the Free-Masons written by  <span class="person">James Anderson</span>. First published in  <span class="date">1723</span> and revised and enlarged in  <span class="date">1738</span>, Anderson's version reigned supreme until the 1880s, when  <span class="person">Robert Freke Gould</span> took Anderson to task in his multivolume work. Others have since done the same or deferred to Gould. Contrary to  <span class="person">Anderson</span>, who carried Freemasonry back to antiquity, even linking it with the biblical creation story,  <span class="person">Gould</span> traced Freemasonry—as distinct from stonemasonry—to the Middle Ages. Later writers have argued that Freemasonry only developed in the seventeenth century, or even later, in Anderson's own lifetime. These newer Freemasons gradually eclipsed older masonic craft guilds, which were absorbed into the new lodges or withered away and disappeared. For Gould and those like him, that was the real history; what Anderson wrote was either his own invention or based on legends, not empirical evidence.6
Even so, in the eighteenth century Anderson was widely respected. As an authoritative statement about Masonic ideas, his Constitutions served as a

 handbook for Masonic lodges and members. If eighteenth-century Masons doubted the truth of Anderson's genealogy, they still could have accepted Masonry as embodying universal truths that were both logical and scientific. Anderson remains the best source for Masonic doctrine in Revolutionary America.
  <span class="person">Anderson</span> characterized himself as the editor and collator of the Constitutions, drawing his information from "ancient Records" and the "faithful traditions of many Ages." He started the Masonic story with the 'Tear of the World,"  <span class="date">4003 B.c.</span>, when God, Supreme Architect of the Universe, created Adam in his own image. With Adam's expulsion from the Garden of Eden the basic skills of Masonry—geometry and the "mechanical arts"—helped reduce humankind's burdens. Adam passed along the craft to his progeny and "since the Fall, we find the Principles of it in the Hearts of his Offspring." Old Testament prophets handed down Masonry from one generation to the next. Through Abraham "God did wisely over-rule" his chosen people "in order to make them good Masons before they possess'd the promis'd land." Under Moses, their "Grand Master," the children of Israel rose as "a whole Kingdom of Masons" after fleeing Egypt. The architectural culmination of their achievement came with Solomon's great temple in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, which stood for over four hundred years. Some 183,600 masons labored under Hiram Abif, "the most accomplish'd Mason upon earth."7
 According to Anderson the Israelites were ultimately defeated and scattered and Solomon's temple was destroyed, but Masonry survived because it was "under the immediate Care and Direction of Heaven." Masonry spread throughout the Mediterranean basin and into the hinterlands of  <span class="place">northern Europe</span> and  <span class="place">India</span> as "this liberal Art" was taught to "free born Sons of eminent Persons." In the British Isles the Angles and Saxons became Christians and "free people" and began to restore the lost skills of Masonry. Prince Edwin, youngest son of King Athelstan, formed the first grand lodge at  <span class="place">York</span> in the  <span class="date">tenth century</span>. English Masonry was strengthened with the arrival of the Normans, who had preserved Masonic traditions in their culture. Britain thereafter rose to greatness, marked by magnificent edifices that were Mason designed and built, including Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul's Cathedral in <span class="place">London</span>.8
 Anderson was a transplanted Scot who lived in London and rubbed shoulders with leading Freemasons of his generation, including  <span class="person">Frederick, Prince of Wales</span>. Anderson wrote that Freemasonry had been embraced by the great men of history and was at heart moral and ethical. Witness,

  <span class="person">Anderson</span> advised, the Tower of Babel and Nebuchadnezzar's foolish efforts to surpass the glory of Solomon's temple. As Anderson explained it, Freemasonry blended mystical and rational, sacred history with the rise of Western civilization, and a message of universal brotherhood with the growing grandeur of Britain.9
 Writers in the next generation of British Masons added to Anderson. Distinguishing between simple masonry and the ideals of Freemasonry, one Mason wrote:

 Masonry passes and is understood under two denominations: it is operative and speculative. By the former, we allude to the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure derives figure, strength, and beauty, and whence results a due proportion and just correspondence in all its parts. By the latter, we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity.

 Another eighteenth-century Masonic author explained that Masonry "never suffered the liberal arts and sciences to be taught to any but the free-born." If later Masonic writers differed with Anderson over some
 details, they still maintained his tone and linked Masonry with progress. One Mason rhapsodized, "In the dark periods of antiquity, when literature was in a low state, and the rude manners of our forefathers withheld from them the knowledge we now so amply share, Masonry began to diffuse
 her influence." The result was beneficial to all: "The mysteries of this science unveiled, arts instantly arose, civilization took place, and the progress of knowledge and philosophy gradually dispelled the gloom of ignorance and barbarism." 10
 In colonial America, prospective Masons had to be nominated for membership, approved unanimously, and, before being exposed to the rituals and secrets of the art, had to agree to abide by the "Charges" set forth in Anderson's Constitutions. No Mason could be "a stupid Atheist,
 nor an irreligious Libertine." All members had to be "good and true Men, free-born, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good report." Masons were equal as brothers within the lodge, although "Masonry takes no Honour from a
 Man that he had before." Those of a higher social station often held the

 most prestigious Masonic offices, but Masons were to promote charity for all. At the same time they were "to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and true, before any other poor People in the same Circumstances." They were not to discuss religion and politics in the lodge, and they were expected to resolve disputes amicably, bringing suit in court only as a last
 resort.11
 Freemasonry was unable to stand above the din of the eighteenth century. Disharmony appeared within Britain's Masonic ranks and led to the founding of a new set of lodges affiliated under a rival grand lodge by  <span class="date">1751</span>. Those with deistic leanings preferred the 1723 edition of Anderson's Constitutions (Moderns), while those who were more orthodox Christians looked to the 1738 edition (Ancients).Ancients were obliged to obey Christian precepts regardless of where they lived; Moderns abided by the prevailing religious belief of their homeland. Apparently some who became Ancients resented the power of London's grand lodge and looked to the older grand lodge in York or others that had sprung up by the middle of the eighteenth century. They may have also resented the domination of London and wanted to appeal more to the middle classes when recruiting new members.12
Whatever the cause of their differences, the rift between Ancients and Moderns in Britain was not mended until  <span class="date">1813</span>. In retrospect the differences separating them appear to have been minor. Disagreements were between individuals, not disputes over key principles. Ancients and Moderns disagreed about the role of Masonry during antiquity—such as the relative importance of Solomon's temple—but both sides claimed to go back to the beginning of time and defined their raison d'etre as a quest to establish moral and ethical principles essential to human happiness and
 social progress. Ancients were expected to abide by the same general code of conduct in promoting virtue and combating vice as were Moderns. Every Mason, Ancient or Modern, was bound to practice charity and to avoid any reference to politics or religion within the lodge. Their rituals may have varied, but Ancients and Moderns passed members through the same three degrees of apprentice, fellow craft, and master mason. They used the same organization of lodges linked together under a grand lodge with masters, wardens, and other officers to preside over their affairs. They observed the same ceremonial days, such as 24 June to celebrate John

the Baptist as patron saint of masons, and 27 December to commemorate St. John the Evangelist.13
 By the  <span class="person">1730s</span>, Masonic lodges affiliated with the grand lodge of London had sprung up in  <span class="place">North America</span>. Lodges formed there received approval from London after they had been organized, so they were more or less autonomous. Eventually the Modern and Ancient dispute in Britain reached the colonies. For example, some Pennsylvania Moderns turned to Ancient lodges, and Pennsylvania's Modern lodges had all but disappeared by the Revolutionary War. The Ancient versus Modern struggle in  <span class="place">Pennsylvania</span>, like that across the Atlantic, may have reflected class divisions, with ambitious mechanics and farmers pitted against merchants and wealthier land
 owners. However, this can be exaggerated since the divisions that split them did not carry over into the Revolutionary crisis. Members of Ancient and Modern lodges in Pennsylvania were in both patriot and Loyalist ranks.14

 The situation was different in  <span class="place">Massachusetts</span>, where Ancients were much more likely than Moderns to be patriots. Boston provides the best example for claiming Freemasonry's connection to the drive for independence. The Brotherhood made its formal Massachusetts debut on  <span class="date">30 July 1733</span>, when a handful of Masons met at the Bunch of Grapes tavern in  <span class="place">Boston</span>. The acting grand master for New England, under a warrant from the grand master of England, formed the grand lodge of St. John's. At least three regular lodges took shape in Boston and over twenty were organized elsewhere in New England, all nominally presided over by Boston's grand lodge of St. John.
  <span class="person">Jeremiah Gridley</span> held the office of grand master when, in  <span class="date">1761</span>, the Modern-Ancient rivalry spilled into Boston. That year a new grand lodge of St. Andrew was formed in Boston under a commission from the grand master of Scottish lodges with an Ancient tie. As far as members of St. Andrew's lodge were concerned this action was no infringement on Gridley’s authority because his warrant came from London, not Edinburgh, and from a grand master of Moderns, not Ancients.

 The Bostonians who founded St. Andrew's had been denied admission to St. John's or the lodges affiliated with it. Nonetheless they extended their hands in a conciliatory gesture and wrote, "the Lodge of St. Andrew being assembled for the purposes of promoting Brotherly Love and Unity

(Philadelphia, 1912-13) is an antiquarian's delight, although Sachse showed both the scarcity of records beyond mere membership lists and brief meeting notices, and the relative weakness of some lodges.

 have unanimously voted [for] a happy Coalition." St. John's responded that the Scottish grand master had interfered where he did not belong. Some who had organized the new lodge were not accredited Masons, and St. John's considered the new lodge "irregular." St. Andrew's retorted that St. John's attitude was "subversive of the Principles of Masonry."15
The grand lodges in  <span class="place">Britain</span> did not get involved in the dispute in Massachusetts since they were trying to work out their own problems and did not want to stir the waters. Nor did Massachusetts Ancients and Moderns press matters. Although the rival lodges did not merge until  <span class="date">1792</span>— twenty-one years before British Ancients and Moderns would do the same—they settled into a relatively peaceful coexistence. Lodge members from both sides even bought copies of Wellins Calcotf s Candid Disquisition, an updated version of Anderson's handbook.16
 The Revolutionary crisis did not noticeably widen divisions in  <span class="place">Massachusett</span>, although there were more Loyalist members of St. John's and more patriot members of St. Andrew's. Leading Boston radicals— <span class="person">Paul Revere</span>,  <span class="person">John Hancock</span>, and  <span class="person">William Molineux</span>—attended St. Andrew's lodge where  <span class="person">Dr. Joseph Warren</span> had been made lodge master in  <span class="date">1768</span>. The next year Warren was named grand master of a new grand lodge for the Ancients; in the reorganization St. Andrew's became one of the lodges under its jurisdiction.  <span class="person">James Oti</span> was one of the few men from St. John's to have spoken or written against imperial policy and by the  <span class="person">late 1760s</span> he did so less often—and more and more erratically.17
 St. Andrew's lodge owned the Green Dragon tavern. "More Revolutionary eggs were hatched in this dragon's nest," quipped Esther Forbes, "than in any other spot in Boston." The North End Caucus, led by Warren, met there, as did the members of St. Andrew's. Some assert that the  <span class="event">Boston Tea Party</span> was planned at the Green Dragon and that the men behind it were  <span class="person">Freemasons</span>. 'This Boston body, like most ancient lodges, was dominated by men active in the revolutionary movement and had a more democratic membership than the older lodge of Boston," proclaimed  <span class="person">John Cary</span>, Warren's biographer.

The official meeting weis often preceded or followed by supper and refreshments. Gathering about the fireplace in the long room, they lighted pipes and cemented the bonds of brotherhood with hot punch, port, and madeira— It was here, more than in the meetings, that talk turned to politics, and to the members of St. Andrew's such talk was congenial indeed.

 In tracing Revere's role in the Tea Party,  <span class="person">Forbes</span> made a similar connection. She noted that Revere was active in the North End Caucus and St. Andrew's lodge and that both groups were known to have had a hand dumping tea into Boston harbor.18

 Although Cary's and Forbes' sources were vague, they drew firm conclusions. Cary was convinced that the "Liberty Party" in and around Boston that led the protest against imperial policy was linked to St. Andrew's lodge: "The building of political sentiment among members of this powerful society was the work of years and was closely associated with masonic social activities." According to Cary, St. Andrew's deserved to be included on the same patriotic list as the North End Caucus, the Monday Night Club, and the Sons of Liberty. Nevertheless, Cary also confessed that the "membership and exact role of each of these groups is still obscure." Furthermore, Warren's personal life, including his involvement in those groups and in political agitation before 1775, was difficult to reconstruct because so little survived.19

 Forbes' picture of Revere is also problematic. Forbes quoted from lodge minutes on the night of the first tea ship's arrival, which stated only that those assembled "adjourned on account of few Brothers present. Ν. B. Consignees of Tea took the Brethren's time." Records for the night of the Tea Party itself are as terse: "Lodge closed on account of few members present." Forbes assumed the importance of Freemasonry to Revere's politics and referred readers to an earlier biography that emphasized Revere's joining and rise to grand master in  <span class="date">1794</span>, but that study offered no insight as to why Revere became a Mason or what Masonic affiliation meant to him.20
 Perhaps Cary and Forbes fell into the same inferential trap as Masonic enthusiasts like Sidney Morse. They read too much into a spotty, fragmentary record. By contrast, historian  <span class="person">Benjamin Labaree</span> was much more

 guarded in his later study of the Tea Party. He observed that many members of the Boston Committee of Correspondence "also belonged to other groups—the North End Caucus, the Long Room Club, and the Grand Lodge of Masons—which may have had a role in the planning as well." Reluctant to establish a strong connection, Labaree qualified his conclusion.21
 The evidence for Masonic involvement in the  <span class="eve">Boston Tea Party</span> and other Revolutionary events is at best inconclusive. Although Morse believed that members of the Providence Masonic lodge sank the Gaspee in June  <span class="date">1772</span>, he had no proof to substantiate his assertion. Moreover, a once commonly held assumption that the Great Seal of the United States reflects Masonic influence, particularly with its all-seeing eye suspended above an incomplete pyramid, has now been challenged. According to the most exhaustive, painstaking account, "it seems likely that the designers of the Great Seal and the Masons took their symbols from parallel sources, and unlikely that seal designers consciously copied Masonic symbols with the intention of incorporating Masonic symbolism into the national coat of arms."22

 Neither did Freemasonry act as a unique unifying force. Massachusetts Ancients and Moderns finally joined hands at the end of the Revolutionary era but a move during the Revolutionary War to combine all Masons under George Washington as national grand master failed, never to be revived. To this day Masonic lodges in the  <span class="place">United States</span>, with their three million or so members—more than anywhere else in the world—are organized under state grand lodges, not a centralized, national organization.23
It is doubtful whether Freemasons qua Freemasons played a significant role in the American Revolution, even as their members joined the Revolutionary movement or stayed loyal to Britain. Masonry as an institution did not figure in the eventual revolt; even so, the ideas and values of Masons may have played a role, along with other beliefs that historians have traditionally linked to the Revolutionary cause.
Instead of searching for something unique in Freemasonry or focusing on the peculiarities of Masonic doctrine, it might prove more useful to see how certain aspects of Masonry reinforced attitudes that were not peculiar to the Brotherhood. Masonry might have been distinctive, a society unto

 itself, but it was also part of Anglo-American culture. Perhaps Masonry contributed to the American revolutionary impulse more indirectly. Masonry as an indirect influence offers a middle ground between the extremes of claiming too much and ignoring the subject altogether. 24
 For example,  <span class="person">Joseph Warren</span>, a leading Revolutionary and Mason, became a Freemason in  <span class="date">1761</span> but was not very active until  <span class="date">1765</span>. Warren's Masonic rise to lodge master in  <span class="date">1768</span> and, a year later, to grand master of the Ancients paralleled his politicization: he emerged simultaneously as a
 spokesman for the "Liberty Party" decried by  <span class="person">Francis Bernard</span> and  <span class="person">Thomas Hutchinson</span>. Cary believed there was a connection, claiming that Warren's "activities in this society were closely related to his political interests." Lodge records are only comparatively full because the North End Caucus, Monday Night Club, and even the Boston Sons of Liberty left virtually none. Lodge records say nothing about Revolutionary sympathies or actions. Warren either never committed to paper his reasons for being a Mason or that personal testament has not survived. In short, there is no
 traceable, direct connection between his Freemasonry and his Revolutionary politics. The same is true of Otis and Revere.25
 In Warren's case, an indirect approach yields more. In  <span class="date">1775</span>, Warren was slain during the fighting on Breed's Hill and the British dumped his body into a simple grave after the battle. Local patriots exhumed and reinterred the remains in  <span class="person">1776</span>.  <span class="person">Perez Morton</span>, master mason and Warren's political ally from earlier years, delivered an address to mark the event. Morton lauded Warren as a virtuous, "matchless Patriot" in his public life and as a 'Tattern for Mankind" in his private affairs. "What a bright example he set [as grand master] to live within Compass, and act upon the Square." Of all Warren's associations, Morton averred, "on none did he place so high a Value" as Masonry. Morton did not state that Masonry was the source of Warren's patriotism or assert that Masons had led the protest against imperial policy, much less that Masons had been behind the
 Boston Tea Party or any other Revolutionary act.26
 But Morton did link the virtues of Masonry with the virtues of the American cause. He felt that Warren had been more noble in death than  <span class="person">General James Wolfe</span> on the Plains of Abraham in  <span class="date">1759</span> because Wolfe "died

 contending for a single Country" while Warren "fell to the Cause of Virtue and Mankind." By paraphrasing Thomas Paine's Common Sense to make the war something more than a colonial revolt, Morton implicitly tied Masonry and the American cause together. Morton implored his listeners that only by fighting for their independence would they honor Warren's sacrifice and ensure that a patriot's blood had not been shed in vain.27
A few months before his death, Warren delivered the fourth annual Boston Massacre oration and proclaimed that "personal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property or an exclusive right to dispose of what he has honestly acquired by his own labor, necessarily arises
 therefrom, are truths which common sense has placed beyond the reach of contradiction." Dozens of patriot orators who were not Masons ex pounded similarly. Yet perhaps Warren's Masonic tie, with its emphasis on the right of freemen to associate voluntarily, strengthened his attachment to such widely held notions.28
 Masonry also could have helped convince Warren that the colonists were victims in a plot to undermine their liberties. Like other patriots, Warren viewed British actions as conspiratorial as well as tyrannical and thereby "repugnant to every principle of reason and natural justice." In
 1775, he reiterated sentiments that he had expressed three years previously in his first oration, when he had condemned "base" British "designs" and "repeated attacks made upon our freedom." For Warren the Revolutionary American susceptibility to conspiratorial fears may have been under scored by Masonic beliefs. In his eulogy Morton lamented that it was Warren's fate, "like the great Master builder of the Temple of old, to fall by the Hands of Ruffians, and be again raised in Honor and Authority." This was a veiled allusion to an essential part of Masonic ritual: master masons were expected to be able to recite how Hiram Abif, master mason of Solomon's temple, was murdered by three "ruffians"—who may have been unscrupulous colleagues. They wanted to know Hiram's secrets and when he refused to tell them, they killed him and hid the body. Hiram was soon discovered by his friends and reburied with great honor. Every time Warren had passed through lodge rituals he heard this tale of a world filled with conspiracy and corruption.29

 Masons pledged to be dutiful citizens who would play no part in such evil doings. "A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works," preached Anderson in his Constitutions, "and is never to be concern'd in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation." Masons had been encouraged, even protected, by rulers over the centuries and they owed fealty to their benefactors.
So that if a Brother should be a Rebel Against the State, he is not to be countenanc'd in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an un happy Man; and if convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible.30

 Rebellion was hateful but, taken alone, it was not reason enough to expel a member. Masonic commitment to virtue and benevolence, as well as to loyalty derived from comity and government based on consent, could ultimately have pushed Warren and other Masons into rebellion.
 Within Masonic lodges the leaders were expected to defer to majority will under the threat of removal as were the grand lodge officers in their dealings with lodges under them. Masonic teaching and protocol did not require unquestioning support of authority inside the lodge or out. "Government, therefore, in some Form or other, must be the Will and Appointment of God," declared one Mason in  <span class="date">1755</span>, so colonists should respect the British constitution and the "just authority" of the king. "The Submission of Individuals must be a most sacred Duty," yet good government "is founded on Consent, and a View to public Good." Resistance to bad government was a last resort, but the "Doctrine of non-resistance is now sufficiently exploded, and may it be eternally treated with that sovereign Contempt which it deserves among a wise and virtuous people."31
 Therefore, when American Revolutionaries eventually fought for independence after first rising to defend their rights under the British constitution, it made perfect sense for Freemasons like Warren to be among

 them. In choosing between loyalty to an empire that required subordination to the Crown and Parliament, on the one hand, or a defense of political autonomy and natural rights, on the other, Masonic doctrine may have helped simplify the choice. For Morton and Warren, Masonry may have strengthened their attachment to a radical Whig political ideology laced with revolutionary undertones. As Morton told his listeners, the American cause and patriotism—like Masonry—were virtuous. Not surprisingly, by the war's end some patriotic Masons even strayed across the line that kept the Brotherhood apolitical, as they linked national independence with the spread of Masonic ideals.32
 Not every Mason became a Revolutionary, and some became or remained Loyalists. Similarly, not every Anglican espoused Loyalism, nor did every Congregationalist fight for independence. A simple institutional explanation for political affiliation is not enough. Nevertheless, it is worth considering how an institutional association might have affected individuals. Freemasonry appealed to thousands of men in eighteenth-century America and thousands more in Britain. Those who became Masons did so for a variety of reasons, including status enhancement, social mobility, camaraderie, civic-mindedness, the satisfaction of mastering a ritual, or curiosity about the occult. Few Masons recorded why they chose to join. That Freemasonry played a part, however indirectly and inadvertently, in the coming of the American Revolution seems plausible. Among those who became Revolutionaries, Masonry could have heightened their fear of a conspiracy against their liberties. If the Revolutionary generation was concerned with the role of virtue in society, as recent historians have stressed, Masonry could have deepened that concern, as well as a sense of community responsibility and filial obligation among those who joined
 and led the Revolutionary movement. At the same time, Masonry could also have pushed others into Loyalism—men who had their sensibilities heightened by Masonic involvement but for their own reasons chose the other side of the political contest.
 Freemasonry should be included as a variation on the ideological and institutional themes that have caught the attention of recent historians. Yet much remains unknown and unknowable. Historians are obliged to draw inferences from incomplete records, a difficult task made even more difficult when dealing with Freemasonry. Did those Masons who became Revolutionaries—or Loyalists—do so because they were already inclined, before they entered the Brotherhood, to think and act a certain way? Or

 December 1782 to Masons assembled in Providence, Rhode Island.



 did their Masonic association accentuate tendencies that would otherwise have lain dormant? Historians can infer and they can surmise, but they may not be able to explain fully the influence of Freemasonry.
