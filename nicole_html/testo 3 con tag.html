Though long perceived as an important commission in <span class="person">Soane's</span> career, his <span class="location">Masonic Hall in London</span> (<span class="date">1828-30</span>) [Figure 1] has never been fully discussed by historians of architecture. Yet the hall was not only the climax of Soane's preoccupation with the poetry of domed top-lit spaces; as a building hemmed in on all sides by others, it was characteristic of the circumstances which produced many of his finest works. Nor has the relation of the Masonic Hall to Soane's great kitchen beneath been noticed, though each interior had an unusual ceiling, totally different from the other, yet designed as part of a hierarchy ascending from the functionalism of the kitchen to the poetry of the Masonic chamber which surmounted it both physically and spiritually. No less important is the fact that this commission raises the whole question of Soane's activities as a Freemason and the meaning which Freemasonry may have held for him.It is surely reasonable to assume that Soane, initiated as a Freemason in <span class="date">1813</span>, took Freemasonry very seriously. He carried out numerous architectural and decorative improvements at the London headquarters of the Freemasons in <span class="location">Great Queen Street</span>, contributed £500 to the cost of his Masonic Hall, and gave extensively to Masonic charities, in accordance with the fraternal ideals of the brotherhood. He took part in Masonic ceremonies and even went so far as to commission a portrait of himself in Masonic dress [Figure 2]. In this portrait, he is shown sitting in his Masonic Hall beside the remarkable Ark of the Masonic Covenant, which he had designed in <span class="date">1813</span>.<sup>2</sup> He even chose to vault the dressing room leading out of his study at <span class="location">Sir John Soane's Museum</span> with a miniature version of his canopy and lantern at the Masonic Hall. No less significantly, Soane's extensive course of reading in the theory of the French Enlightenment made him aware that Freemasonry could be regarded as the religion of the Enlightenment. He reflected its deistic philosophy in his own references to God as "the Architect of the Universe," and in his numerous designs for funerary monuments, tombs.
Here's the revised text with the identified elements enclosed in HTML `<span>` tags:

His intensive study of Recherches sur l'origine, I'esprit et les progres des arts de la Grece (3 vols. London, 1785), by <span class="person">"Baron d'Hancarville"</span> (Pierre-Fran:ois Hugues), had familiarized him with the search for a common origin of the varieties of religious experience which was characteristic of Enlightenment thought. D'Hancarville's activities in this field reflected the visionary world order of contemporary Freemasons, while his study of religious and sexual symbolism gave Soane material for detailed study as part of his own growing preoccupation with the question of finding appropriate ornament for modern classical buildings.<sup>3</sup> Soane also owned the great Encyclopedie of <span class="person">Diderot</span> and <span class="person">d'Alembert</span> with its title page adorned with Masonic symbols. His collection of Masonic books also included the key study by <span class="person">Alexandre Lenoir</span> (1761-1839), La Franche-Mafonnerie rendue a sa veritable origine, ou l'antiquite de la franche-mafonnerie par l'explication des mysteres anciens et modernes (Paris, 1814). It was Lenoir, a Freemason, who had established the celebrated Musee des Monuments Francais in <span class="date">1795</span> in the former <span class="location">Couvent des Petits Augustins in Paris</span>.<sup>4</sup> It is not known whether Soane saw this theatrically arranged but instructive museum of architecture and sculpture on his visits to Paris, but it afforded a number of visual and intellectual parallels with his own house and museum in <span class="location">Lincoln's Inn Fields</span>.<sup>5</sup> Soane was also one of the few in <span class="location">England</span> to own a copy of C.-N. Ledoux's monumental L'Architecture consideree sous le rapport de l'art, des moeurs, et de la legislation(Paris, 1804), with its striking frontispiece in which Ledoux was depicted with the attributes of Freemasonry. Ledoux's book was, indeed, the architectural culmination of the growing interest in Freemasonry and secret societies in eighteenth-century France. Soane copied out chunks of the rhapsodic, incantatory prose in which Ledoux evoked a city based on Masonic social ideals. Soane's passionate belief in the exercise of civic virtue and in the design of public buildings as the noblest task of the architect was also in harmony with asonic idealism. In this context, the recent summary by <span class="person">James Stevens Curl</span>.of what Freemasonry meant to the thinkers of the Enlightenment applies in every particular to Soane: 

Freemasons sought a return to simple, primitive, elemental truths, and a reconstruction of a noble, unfalse, altruistic progress from those truths along the civilized paths of architectural history in which the language of the Orders, the Temple of Solomon, and Reason would play their parts. Freemasons desired to rebuild a moral edifice, no less, as an exemplar of what was noble and splendid and true in the first ages of the world.<sup>6</sup> 

Other books by French Freemasons in Soane's possession included Monde primitif, analyse et compare avec le monde modeme, considere sans son genie et dans les allegories auxquelles conduisit ce genie (Paris, 1777), by <span class="person">Antoine Court de Gebelin</span>, and Lettres sur l'architecture des anciens et celle des modernes, dans lesquelles se trouve developpe le egnie symbolique qui preside aux monuments de l'antiquite (Paris, 1787), by <span class="person">Jean-Louis Viel de Saint-Maux</span>, a member, like Court de Gebelin, of the >Neuf Soeurs Lodge in Paris. Soane bought Court de Gebelin's book on <span class="date">17 December 1814</span>, just eleven days after he was reappointed Grand Superintendant [szc] of Works at the Grand Master's Lodge in <span class="location">London</span>. In the writings of Court de Gebelin and Viel de Saint-Maux, both of whom were indebted to Soane's favorite archaeological writer, <span class="person">d'Hancarville</span>, he would have found accounts of the origin of the sacred architecture of the ancients which stressed the role of allegory and symbolism. They promoted a vision of world architecture rich with the signs of religion, myth, and cosmology while for <span class="person">Court de Gebelin</span>, the sublime drama of initiatory rituals provided a continuity from the Egyptian world to that of Demeter, Persephone, and Orpheus, and so to that of modern Freemasonry. Soane's friend <span class="person">James Christie</span> (1773-1831) explored similar topics in a series of books of which he sent copies to Soane. These included the remarkable Disquisition upon Etruscan Vases; displaying their probable connection with the Shows at Eleusis, and the Chinese Feast of Lanterns, with explanations of a few of the principal allegories depicted on them (London, 1806), An Essay on that earliest Species of Idolatry, the Worship of the Elements (Norwich, 1814), and An Essay on the Mysteries of Eleusis(London, 1817). Soane referred to Christie's writings in his Description of the House and Museum on the North Side of Lincoln's Inn Fields (1835), and invited him in 1825 to the grand showing by lamplight of his newly acquired tomb of Seti I, an Egyptian antiquity of major significance which he knew as the Belzoni sarcophagus, after the name of its discoverer in 1817.<sup>7</sup> Regretting that he was unable to attend, Christie wrote to Soane that the "exhibition would be so particularly interesting to me as it would coincide so nearly with my speculations upon the lamplight exhibitions at Eleusis."<sup>8</sup> The control of light in ceremonies, particularly of initiation, which was also a preoccupation of <span class="person">Lenoir</span>, also featured, as we shall see, in Soane's Masonic Hall. <span class="person">Giovanni Battista Belzoni</span> (1778-1823) belonged to the Masoni group centering on the <span class="person">Duke of Sussex</span>, who attended Soane's installation of the Belzoni sarcophagus in <span class="date">1825</span>.<sup>9</sup> Other members of this lodge who became Soane's friends included <span class="person">James Pery</span> (1756-1821), proprietor and editor of the Morning Chronicle, the leading organ of the Whig party. He was one of the few of Soane's friends who was part of the official procession at Mrs. Soane's funeral in 1815. On 14 August 1813 Soane called on the <span class="person">Duke of Sussex</span>; on <span class="date">15 November</span> he was proposed for election to the Grand Master's Lodge by <span class="person">James Pery</span> and <span class="person">Thomas Harper</span>; and on <span class="date">1 December</span> he was initiated. <span class="person">Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex</span> (1773-1843), the sixth son of <span class="person">King George III</span> and <span class="date">Queen Charlotte</span>, was educated in Germany at Gottingen University and did not settle in England till <span class="date">1804</span>.<sup>10</sup> Doubtless influenced by Professor <span class="person">Ludwig Wilhelm Meyer</span>, a Freemason who had taught him at <span class="location">Gottingen</span>, he was initiated into continental Freemasonry in the Lodge of Glorious Truth in <span class="location">Berlin</span> in <span class="date">1798</span>.<sup>11</sup> A man of unusually advanced liberal views for a royal prince, he had a sympathy for reform of all sorts;<sup>12</sup> like Soane, he also had a romantic admiration for <span class="person">Napoleon</span>.<sup>13</sup> Unwelcome at court, he devoted himself to literature, science, and the arts. He was appointed president of the Society of Arts in <span class="date">1816</span>, served as president of the Royal Society from <span class="date">1830</span> to <span class="date">1839</span>, and formed a library of 50,000 volumes,<sup>14</sup> which included several works privately printed by <span class="person">Soane</span>.<sup>5</sup> He became a close friend of Soane and, though he did not engage him to carry out any private commissions, he was almost certainly responsible for inviting Soane to work for the Freemasons.<sup>16</sup> Following his initiation in <span class="date">1813</span> Soane was immediately put to work to design an ark of the Masonic covenant to be used at an important ceremony that was to take place on <span class="date">27 December</span>.<sup>17</sup> This was the union of the two fraternities, known as the Grand Lodge, founded in <span class="date">1717</span>, and the Antient Grand Lodge, founded as its rival in <span class="date">1751</span><.<sup>18</sup> The union was important as symbolizing Masonic ideals of sociability and fraternity, which had been violated by the painful separation. The decision to commission an ark, a most unusual step, emphasized the high solemnity of this novel ceremony.

HISTORY OF THE SITE OF THE MASONIC HALL
Before proceeding any further we should set the scene Soane's Masonic activities by glancing at the history of the which was occupied by the Freemasons in <span class="location">Great Queen Street</span>. At its core was the magnificent two-story <span class="location">Masonic Hall</span>, built in <span class="date">1775-76</span> from designs by <span class="person">Thomas Sandby</span>, who was pointed Grand Architect of the Order of Freemasons in [Figure 3]. Opened at a solemn ceremony in <span class="date">1776</span>< at which was dedicated to Masonry, Virtue, Universal Charity, Benevolence, the <span class="location">Masonic Hall</span> resembled the interior of a great Roman Doric temple.<sup>20</sup> <span class="person">Sandby</span>, who had promoted a kind of speaking or symbolic architecture in his Royal Academy lectures, adorned the metopes in the frieze with Masonic emblems, triangles, intersecting circles, suns, and stars.<sup>21</sup> In the center of the ceiling, a representation of the sun in burnished gold was surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac.<sup>22</sup> To the north of this, a building with an undemonstrative, domestic-looking facade on <span class="location">Great Queen Street</span>, known as the Freemasons' Tavern, was built in  <span class="date">1786</span>. The architect of this modest Palladian composition was <span class="person">William Tyler</span>, a Freemasons, who had already promoted the building of Sandby's Masonic Hall in <span class="date">1775</span>. <span class="person">Sandby</span> enjoyed the patronage of the <span class="person">Duke of Cumberland</span>, who was Grand Master from <span class="date">1782</span> until his death in <span class="date">1790</span>. It was his father, <span class="person">Frederick, Prince of Wales</span> (1707-51), the patron of <span class="person">Sir William Chambers</span> at <span class="location">Kew</span>, who began the connection of the royal family with the Freemasons which contributed so much to the growth of their popularity. Two years after the <span class="person">Duke of Cumberland's</span> death in 1790, he was succeeded as <span class="concept">Grand Master</span> by his nephew, the <span class="person">Prince of Wales</span>, the future <span class="person">George IV</span>, who had been initiated on <span class="date">6 February 1787</span>. The <span class="person">Prince of Wales's</span> opinions had doubtless been influenced by his friendship with the liberal and anglophile <span class="person">duc de Chartres, later Philippe-Egalite</span>, who had been installed as Grand Master of the Grand Orient in <span class="date">October 1773</span>. Two years after his appointment as regent in 1811, the prince was in turn succeeded as Grand Master by his brother, the <span class="person">Duke of Sussex</span>. On resigning the grand mastership, the <span class="person">Prince Regent took the title of Grand Patron of the Order, a position he retained after his accession to the throne in 1820.

SOANE AS A FREEMASON
On <span class="date">11 December 1813</span> <span class="person">Soane</span> met the <span class="person">Duke of Sussex</span> at the <span class="location">Freemasons' Tavern</span>, taking with him three drawings, possibly for the new ark. <span class="person">Soane's</span> surviving designs for the ark include one, dated <span class="date">December 1813</span>, which is triangular in form with a column at each corner <sup>23</sup>. It was a version of this design which was executed.<sup>24</sup> Although destroyed in the great fire of <span class="date">1883</span>, it can clearly be seen in the painting by <span class="person">Sigismund Rosenthal</span>, The Reception of the Prince of Wales as a Past Grand Master in <span class="date">December 1869</span>.<sup>24</sup> Since the ceremony in which this unusual object was to feature was due to take place in a little over two weeks, Soane was given very little time for the design and execution. We know from the office day book, kept by his chief assistant, <span class="person">George Bailey</span>, that the ark was designed between <span class="date">14 and 20 December</span>, with the burning of much midnight oil. The drawings were fed through piecemeal to Soane's favoritejoiner and cabinetmaker, <span class="date">Thomas Martyr</span>.<sup>26</sup> Soane's ark bore no resemblance to the conventional Biblcal ark, a modest, portable object, ofwhich an image featured in the arms of both the United Grand Lodge of England and of the Antient Grand Lodge. Those representations were based on the directions given to Moses for an ark to contain God's Testimony, to be made of shittim wood (acacia) and flanked by two cherubim.<sup>27</sup> Soane's mahogany ark was totally different.
Four feet three inches high and three feet four inches wide, it was triangular with a column at each comer, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, symbolizing wisdom, strength, and beauty, each bearing its appropriate entablature. With its tall central door, it resembled a large cupboard, pedestal, or, characteristically for Soane, tomb. It was also formally similar to the triangular Simeon Monument, which he built in the <span class="location">Market Place in Reading</span> in <span class="date">1804</span>, an obelisk and lamp post rich with symbolic ornament.28 More significantly, Soane's ark is close to the curious pedestals, triangular with domed finials, which feature in his Pitt Cenotaph at the National Debt Redemption Office of <span class="date">1818</span>.<sup>29</sup> These mysterious commemorative pedestals add to the gloomy solemnity of the cenotaph in a manner that is wholly characteristic of their architect. Other drawings show Soane's rearrangement of Sandby's hall, presumably for the great ceremony of union. A tall reredos, hung with a veil, is flanked by coupled columns arranged in three tiers [Figure 5].<sup>30</sup> At the ceremony, Brother Soane, who had bought a purple apron trimmed with gold fringe, bore the pillar of the Junior Grand Warden of the Antients. He witnessed the ceremony, accompanied by organ music played by <span class="person">Samuel Wesley</span>, which centered on his new ark:

The Square, the Plumb, the Level and the Mallet, were successively delivered to the Deputy Grand Masters and by them presented to the two Grand Masters who severally applied the Square to that part of the said Ark, which is square, the plumb to the sides of the same and the Level above it in three positions, and lastly they gave three knocks with the mallet; saying "May the Great Architect of the universe enable us to uphold the Grand Edifice of union of which this ark of the Covenant is the symbol, which shall contain within it the Instrument of our Brotherly Love, and bear upon it the Holy Bible, Square and Compass, as the light of our Faith and the rule of our works may he dispose our Hearts to make it perpetual!" The two Grand Masters placed the said act of Union in the Interior of the said ark. The Cornucopia, the Wine and Oil, were in like manner presented to the Grand Masters, who, according to antient rite, poured forth corn, wine and oil on the said ark.<sup>31</sup>


The <span class="person">Duke of Sussex</span> then installed <span class="person">Soane</span> as Grand Superintendent of Works, a post he held until his death in <span class="date">1837</span>. The significance of the post went beyond the design of an ark or the rearrangement shown in the other drawings prepared at the time, for at the same meeting on <span class="date">27 December</span> a Board of Works had been established, with Soane as a member. This had the two following objectives: "the proper accommodation of the Grand Lodge and its several Boards and Committees at their respective meetings" and "the correct and appropriate decorations and Furniture of the grand Lodge and the Masonic Jewels, Emblems and Clothing of the Grand Officers and other Brethren." These implied a new building and a decorative program centered on appropriate ornament, just the topic with which Soane was so preoccupied at this time, when he was preparing his Royal Academy lectures. In <span class="date">1813</span> he had delivered his first course of six lectures, and was to deliver the second course for the first time in <span class="date">1815</span>, in which year he was also appointed President of the Board of Works at the United Grand Lodge. In <span class="date">1814</span> he surveyed the houses adjacent to the Freemasons' Tavern on the east, at <span class="location">62 and 63 Great Queen Street</span>, with a view to their purchase so as to enable new premises to be built. They were purchased in <span class="date">1815</span> and on <span class="date">20 June</span> Soane recorded that he "went by Hackney carriage to the Duke of Sussex at Kensington Palace," presumably to show him drawings for a new building, and "returned to the Tavern in his coach." We also know that on <span class="date">17 May 1816</span> Soane showed to the Duke of Sussex four drawings for a new Masonic Hall. In fact, no new chamber was built for twelve years, despite the pressing need for increased accommodation following the Union of the two grand lodges in <span class="date">1813</span>. Instead, Soane carried out repairs and alterations to the existing buildings in <span class="date">1816</span>. In <span class="date">1821</span> he turned his attention to Sandby's Great Hall, taking plans to the Duke of Sussex for his approval on <span class="date">19 October</span>. Soane remodeled the gallery and arcades and also moved the organ. Fifteen years earlier, he had begun his preparation for his role as professor of architecture at the Royal Academy by making copies of the six lectures which had been delivered by Sandby, his revered predecessor as professor. Soane would have felt an appropriateness in following Sandby, first by becoming a Freemason and later by making alterations to Sandby's Great Hall. The new Masonic Hall. In <span class="date">1826</span> Soane began to prepare further designs for the Masonic Hall which had been envisaged as early as <span class="date">1814</span> on property on <span class="location">Great Queen Street</span>, bought in <span class="date">1815</span> on recommendation. The four designs which he had made <span class="date">1816</span> are now lost, but we have four plans by him for the chamber, dated <span class="date">16 April</span> and <span class="date">27 May 1826</span>. The drawings are bizarre geometrical exercises in H and T plan forms, including one for a tripartite hall, comprising three spaces of contrasting shapes: at the south, a rectangle curved apsidal ends; a domed square in the center; and, at north, a rectangular space with 

Following a two-year delay, he drew up further plans in <span class="date">1828</span>, many of them dated from the office which he maintained at <span class="location">Chelsea Hospital</span> in his capacity as Clerk of the Works. By this time the idea of a single large room, whether of tripartite or bipartite form, had been abandoned in favor of a smaller Masonic Hall with a separate room at right angles to it on the south side. The hall formed the upper part of a substantial new building with a kitchen and scullery on the ground floor and a new staircase on the west side. The hall was 45 feet by 35 feet, with a recess nearly four feet deep for an organ on the west side. The room to its south, with three south-facing windows, was 32 feet 10 inches by 17 feet 6 inches. Soane's initial ideas for the hall are revealed in one of the most extraordinary designs of his whole career, inscribed in his hand as "Exhibited as a general idea to HRH the Duke of Sussex at Kensington Palace June 1828" [Figure 7]. It is for a neo-Tudor interior in an unmistakably Soanean manner, boasting a roof of notched timber beams surmounted by groin vaults and shallow domes, and lit with mullioned windows containing diamond-paned glass. The walls are lined with the kind of simplified linenfold paneling which featured in Soane's Law Courts at Westminster Hall of <span class="date">1822-25</span>. The room thus belongs to that late phase in his career when he seemed to be moving toward a style that was a synthesis of classical and Gothic appropriate to historic or national institutions. The Tudor flavor was largely dropped in the executed design, which was, nonetheless, one the most personal and richly ornamented interiors of his career. The handsome new kitchen [Figures 8-9] which supported the hall had arcaded side walls of contrasting design and a timber-trussed roof, strikingly exposed, of a Palladian type first introduced to England by <span class="person">Inigo Jones</span> and <span class="date">Christopher Wren</span>. Soane was familiar with Jones's use of truss construction at the Banqueting House, for he rebuilt its ceiling in <span class="date">1811</span>, incorporating iron tie rods. The drawings of Swiss timber bridges which he made for the Earl Bishop of Deny would also have been useful to him in this context. Soane chose a characteristically inward-looking way of hinting at the significance of his kitchen design, as well as its relation to that of the Masonic Hall above: this was to include a perspective view of it propped up as an exhibit in drawings by Gandy of the Masonic Hall itself. It may not be too far-fetched to see the progression from the timber trussing of the kitchen to the hovering canopy in the hall above as representing Masonic ritual ascent from manual labor to spiritual enlightenment. Soane's surviving drawings of <span class="date">1828-29</span> for the Masonic Hall as executed record a familiar path in the designs of many classical architects from initial richness of ornament to comparative simplicity. Some early designs show the room articulated with the most sumptuous Corinthian order [Figure 10], instead of the Ionic eventually adopted, while others include pilasters crowded with rinceaux in a somewhat Adamesque style.
The spandrels of the central, canopied dome are pierced by circular openings, like those in the breakfast room of John Soane's Museum [Figure 11]; and in others, the lantern above is ringed with miniature caryatids. What remained throughout was the basic, and highly unusual, disposition of the room [Figures 12-13]: the two sides featured end bays containing chimneypieces, with dows oddly placed over them; the centers of the long sides occupied by tripartite compositions, rather like triumphal arches, in which pedimented false door cases flanked arched and coffered recesses containing on the west side an organ and on the east side a ceremonial throne. The shorter north and south sides each received a similar tripartite treatment, with a throne in the center of the former and the main entrance in the center of the latter. Additional light filtered through four segmental clerestory windows, one high up in the center wall, and, more significantly, from the tall, glazed lantern> which surmounted the central hanging canopy. As was customary with Soane's profoundly three-dimensional interior spaces, the vaulted ceiling provided the index of the whole design. The bays containing the windows and chimneypieces were linked across the room by broad segmental arches, ornamented with coffering. Here began the uncanny feeling which permeated the room: by inserting a window immediately over a chimneypiece <span class="person">Soane</span> reversed normal functional procedure, for the area devoted to the window was that customarily reserved for the flue. He further stressed the constructional daring by resting the coffered vaults not on walls but on the heads of the windows, thus suggesting that masonry was supported on glass. The most memorable feature of the room also challenged expectations of constructional propriety. This was the pendant dome in the form of an unsupported canopy, resembling Soane's favorite "sarcophagus lid" motif [Figure 14]. Silhouetted against the golden light filtering from the lantern this canopy would have hovered above the room "like a out-spread bat's wing.<sup>38</sup> Fortunately, we can appreciate highly unusual form of the lantern from the miniature
which Soane chose to reproduce in the dressing room in the Soane museum. From this we can see that, with its high, canted sides, it had a steep profile which is Gothic or Baroque in flavor, not classical.<sup>39</sup> By this time in his career, colored light was central to <span class="person">Soane's</span> understanding of the effects which architecture should create. Thus the four side windows were glazed with richly colored and patterned glass, including a yellow diaper on an orange ground, while the compartments in the central lantern above the "sarcophagus lid" contained the signs of the zodiac in yellow ground glass alternating with rosettes [Figure 15]. The painted glass in the four clerestorey windows contained representations of five columns, a Masonic reference to the five orders of antiquity<sup>40</sup>. Columns lined up in this way were a familiar device on the craft certificates and invitation cards of eighteenth-century English lodges<sup>41</sup>. The image of constructional daring suggested by the central pendant dome or canopy was reinforced by heavy bronze chandeliers that Soane chose to hang from its four corners, ostensibly its weakest points. We know from the bill supplied on <span class="date">2 January 1830</span> by <span class="person">William Collins</span>, Glass Enameller and Glass Manufacturer, that the chandeliers were, in fact, suspended by concealed iron rods which were covered with crimson cords and tassels<sup>42</sup>. Early drawings showed a more conventional arrangement by which the chandeliers were suspended from the ceiling beams<sup>43</sup>. Collins also supplied eight "japanned back lamps for lighting the dome" at a cost of £4, further heightening the ethereal atmosphere which evidently prevailed in the room at night. This is the eerie mood which <span class="person">Joseph Gandy</span> caught in his evocative watercolor of the room, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1832 under the title, Interior of the edifice devoted exclusively to Freemasonry adjoining Freemasons' Hall, in Great Queen Street-an evening view made after the completion of the building (see Figure 1)<sup>44</sup>. Its mood supports the suggestion that "there is an all-pervasive religiosity about masonic sociability...[in which] we may find that 'heavenly city' offered by the secular philosophies of the eighteenth century to their worldly and cosmopolitan followers.<sup>45</sup> <span class="person">Gandy</span> shows us what resembles a stage scene, artificially lit and framed by a proscenium arch of curtains. Furniture is elaborately laid out but as yet unoccupied by the actors. At the far end is the ceremonial chair and pedestal for the Master of the Lodge, flanked by a chair on his left for the Immediate Past Master, and one on his right for a visiting dignitary. On the pedestal, which is a Masonic term for a small desk, the Bible, square, and compasses are placed at major ceremonies. This disposition is echoed in the foreground, where there is a ceremonial chair and pedestal for the Senior Warden, flanked by the Junior Deacon on his right and the Inner Guard on his left. Halfway down the righthand side a pedestal for the Secretary and Treasurer of the lodge, and chairs for the Senior Deacon and for the Master of Ceremonies and his ADC.<sup>46</sup> Beside each pedestal there is a candle stand, traditionally in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, representing the three lesser lights: the sun, moon, and Master of the Lodge.47 The three greater lights are the master and the two wardens. Near the center of the room is <span class="person">Soane's</span> ark. The careful attention which <span class="person">Soane</span> paid to the disposition of the furnishings is shown in a surviving plan [Figure 16] and a "perspective to show the arrangement of seats &c chairs, benches, throne [Figure 17].<sup>48</sup> There can be no doubt that in the Masonic Hall Soane intended to create, in classical terms, a daring and sublime Gothic aesthetic effect akin to the Tudoresque flavor of the design which he had presented to the <span class="person">Duke of Sussex</span> in <span class="date">June 1828</span>. The room, as executed, was a piece of speaking architecture, rich with symbolic and natural ornament as in Gothic churches. Its ornamental complexity helps explain why it took so long to complete: the foundation stone was laid in the <span class="date">summer of 1828</span> but the room was not finally completed until early in <span class="date">1831</span>. On a drawing of <span class="date">10 August 1828</span>, Soane noted, "Motives of Ceremony Determined the height, in order to have the decoration complete as to character. It must be observed the great room is very much enriched."49 Bills from the plasterer, <span class="person">Thomas Palmer</span>, for work carried out from June 1828 to March 1829, include references to classical ornaments such as "4 genii" and "Roman candelabra," but also to ornament based on English plants and trees such as thistle, shamrock, rose, oak</span>.50 On one of Soane's drawings for a wall elevation, an ornamental panel is inscribed as decorated with "bundles or rods and ribbons and oak leaves & shamrock twisted around them."<sup>51</sup> In the portrait by <span class="person">John Jackson</span> of Soane in Masonic dress he is wearing a collar strikingly embroidered with wheat and acacia (see Figure 2). This painting is also of interest in showing the golden-brown coloring of the interior of the Masonic Hall: we know that the walls and vault were grained and varnished in a light oak color, while the pilasters of the door cases were painted in imitation of Siena marble. We can also see in Jackson's painting the glowing spots of color provided by the painted glass in the windows, which he shows as divided by a strong central mullion, providing a certain Tudor or seventeenth-century flavor. In <span class="date">May and June 1829 </span> Soane spent much time working out designs for the decoration of the organ case.52 These include a highly original wave border [Figure 18], which is probably a hermetic symbol of eternity, recalling the similar patterns which he included on theSoane Family Tomb in  <span class="date">1816</span>. The organ is an important reminder of the role played by music in this interior, in which he gave a final, moving expression to his preoccupation with colored light, music, and poetic effects. The ambition of creating a unity of the arts was one he had found expressed in that key work by his fellow Freemasons, <span class="person">Nicolas Le Camus de Mezieres</span>, Le genie de l'architecture; ou, I'analogie de cet art avec nos sensations (Paris, 1780). <span class="person">Soane</span> had spent much time in translating sections of this book in <span class="date">1806</span> in preparation for his Royal Academy lectures. <span class="person">Sandby's Masonic Hall</span> echoed to the sound of music on <span class="date">20 June 1835</span>, when, rather improbably, it was the scene of a ball held in <span class="person">Soane's</span> honor by his brother masons and architectural colleagues.<sup>53</sup> Soane was too frail to attend the ball, but was present at a ceremony held beforehand in <span class="location">13 Lincoln's Inn Fields</span> at which he was presented with the newly instituted Gold Medal of the Institute of British Architects. The great Masonic Hall by <span class="person">Sandby</span> was gaily, if incongruously, decorated with bunting, but also with drawings and designs by Soane, together with wreathed busts on circular pedestals of architects such as Michelangelo, Palladio, Jones, Wren, Taylor, Chambers, Adam, and Wyatt. Chantrey's bust of Soane, borrowed from the Soane museum, had pride of place at the far end. Sadly, despite these tributes, Soane's own Masonic Hall was altered three years later by the addition of an apsidal end on the south side from designs by <span class="person">Philip Hardwick</span>.<sup>54</sup> It seems that its users had increasingly felt that its position was awkward and its size inadequate.<sup>55</sup> As a result, in <span class="date">1863</span> it was entirely demolished to make way for a new Masonic building by C. R. Cockerell's son, <span class="person">F. P. Cockerell</span>, who should have known better. 
CONCLUSION 
The loss of an interior of such startling intensity was a tragedy for, as we can now see, it was probably a more complete physical expression of Masonic metaphor than anything achieved Soane's contemporaries. For a parallel one has to return to unexecuted designs of 1774-75 for a Masonic temple <span class="person">Charles De Wailly</span>, who, like <span class="person">Soane</span>, was a master in handling of light to create poetic and emotional effects.56 <span class="person">Wailly</span> had been initiated to Freemasonry in <span class="location">Paris</span> in<span class="date"> 1774</span> in same lodge to which Soane's hero, Le Camus de Mezieres, belonged. This was the "Respectable <span class="person">Loge des Coeurs Simples de Wailly</span> was not initiated as a Freemason until <span class="date">1813</span>, when he was already sixty. Yet it is perfectly possible that his solitary, questing mind and his intensive course of reading had already brought him to occupy a position which echoed that of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment as expressed in the ideals of continental <span class="person">Freemasonry</span>.
