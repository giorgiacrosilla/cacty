                was founded in <span class="date-1800">1832</span>. I will return to this topic shortly.</lb>
                Yale was good
                at what it did. The official history of the college puts it this way:</lb>
                Yale was
                exasperately and mysteriously successful, and the power of the place remains unmistakable. Yale was
                organized. Yale</lb>
                inspired a loyalty in its sons that was conspicuous and impressive. Yale men made such records [in
                their careers] that . . . to</lb>
                rival institutions and academic reformers there was something</lb>
                irritating and disquieting about old Yale<lb>
                    One <span class="role">Harvard alumnus</span> was quoted as saying that he intended to send his son
                    to Yale because,
                    “in real life, all the Harvard</lb>
                men are working for Yale men.”</lb>
                In the second half of the 19th century, Yale college produced four men who
                were to play pivotal roles in creating a</lb>
                new and distinctly American kind of university and in the way</lb>
                medicine was taught in this country:</lb>

                succeeded in persuading over a hundred Bonesmen to break their vow of silence</lb>
                and speak to her about the society. She has published a book</lb>
                entitled Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and</lb>
                the Hidden Paths of Power. In doing so, she experienced harassment and not-so-subtle threats; she

                in which meetings are held each Th ursday and Sunday evening</lb>
                (Figure 1). These are massive, very impressive structures, foreboding and bearing an unmistakable
                message:
                “Private; keep</lb>
                out.” Although the activities of the society are secret, their</lb>
                existence and membership are not. Rather than being hidden</lb>
                away in some dark recess of the Yale Campus, Skull and Bones</lb>
                lies directly across High Street from Yale Old Campus, where</lb>

                    has done a good job in identifying these unique individuals</lb>

                    important administrative positions, deanships, and faculty posts</lb>
                    at Yale were
                    held by Bonesmen, and the governing Yale Corporation was liberally sprinkled

                    <span class="role">Keys</span>. At times, it could be said that Yale college was a wholly</lb>

                    potential, so it becomes important not to offend the “wrong people.” It is tempting to gawk, each
                    Thursday evening, at the sight of
                    15 somber figures, clad in dark</lb>
                    grey flannel, filing into that huge foreboding mausoleum while</lb>
                    singing some obscure ancient secret tune; it wouldn’t do to be</lb>
                    found there 4 or 5 hours later when they emerge from their</lb>
                    secret doings or to stand on the sidewalk and heckle them on</lb>
                    their appointed rounds. To do so might invite a blackball. But</lb>
                    then again, some couldn’t care less, or so they say.

                    An enduring foundation; a slow development, first local, then</lb>

                    elsewhere neglected in this country; a generous affiliation with</lb>
                    all other institutions, avoiding interferences and engaging in</lb>
                    no rivalry; the encouragement of research; the promotion of</lb>

                    the visionary, the encourager, the seeker of bright students and faculty with fresh ideas. He
                    encouraged the publication of the</lb>
                    research results from the fledgling school, and at his backing</lb>
                    the Johns Hopkins Press became the first publication agency of</lb>
                    a university. It was established in <span class="date-1800">1878</span> to publish the
                    American</lb>
                    Journal of Mathematics

            in chemistry, philology, biology, history, and political science,</lb>
            all edited and supported by the Hopkins faculty. He built up</lb>
            the intellectual atmosphere of the school by inviting prominent</lb>
            men of learning to deliver public lectures at the John Hopkins, a common</lb>
            practice in our day but a bold innovation at the time.</lb>
            Some measure of his infl uence and importance in American</lb>

                reclusive, extremely private man with few close friends and</lb>
