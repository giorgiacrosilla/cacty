        <div class="text" lang="en">
            <p>The bare facts about the birth of the Ku Klux Klan and its
                revival
                half a century later are
                baffling
                to
                most
                people today. Little more than a year after it was founded, the secret society thundered across
                the
                war-torn
                South, sabotaging <span class="event reconstruction">Reconstruction</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era" target="_blank"><span

                        link
                    </span></a> governments and imposing a reign of terror and violence that
                lasted
                three or
                four years. And then as rapidly as it had spread, the Klan faded into the history books. After
                <span class="event ww1">World War I</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"
                    target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>, a
                new version of the Klan sputtered to life and within a few years brought many parts of the
                nation
                under
                its
                paralyzing grip of racism and blood shed. Then, having grown to be a major force for the second
                time,
                the Klan
                again receded into the background. This time it never quite disappeared, but it never again
                commanded
                such
                widespread support. <br>
                Today, it seems incredible that an organization so violent, so opposed to the American
                principles of <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()">justice and equality</span>,
                could
                twice in the nation’s
                history have held such power. How
                did
                the Ku
                Klux Klan — one of the nation’s first terrorist groups — so instantly seize the South in the
                aftermath
                of the
                <span class="event civilwar">Civil War</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"
                    target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>? Why did it so quickly vanish? How could it have
                risen
                so
                rapidly to
                power in the <span class="date 1900">1920s</span> and then so
                rapidly have lost that power? And why is this ghost of the <span class="event civilwar"> Civil
                    War
                </span> still
                haunting
                America today with hatred,
                violence and sometimes death for its enemies and its own members?
            </p>
            <h2>Frontier Justice </h2>
            <p>The answers do not lie on the surface of American history. They are deeper than the events of
                the
                turbulent
                <span class="date 1900">1960s</span>, the parades and cross burnings and lynchings of the <span
                    class="date 1900">1920s</span>,
                beyond
                even the
                <span class="event reconstruction">Reconstruction</span> era and the
                <span class="event civilwar"> Civil War</span>. The story begins, really, on the frontier,
                where
                successive
                generations
                of Americans learned hard
                lessons about survival. Those lessons produced some of the qualities of life for which the
                nation is
                most
                admired — <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()">fierce individualism,
                    enterprising
                    inventiveness, and the
                    freedom to be whatever a
                    person
                    wants and to
                    go wherever a new road leads.</span>
                <br>
                But the frontier spirit included other traits as well, and one was a stubborn
                insistence on the prerogative of "frontier justice" — an instant, private, very personal and
                often
                violent
                method of settling differences without involving lawyers or courts. As the frontier was
                tamed
                and
                churches,
                schools and courthouses replaced log trading posts, settlers substituted law and order for
                the
                older
                brand of
                private justice. But there were always those who did not accept the change. The quest for
                personal
                justice or
                revenge became a key motivation for many who later rode with the Ku Klux Klan, especially
                among
                those

            <h2>Night Patrols</h2>
            <p>A more obvious explanation of the South’s widespread acceptance of the Klan is found in the
                institution
                of
                slavery. Freedom for slaves represented for many white Southerners a bitter defeat — a defeat
                not
                only
                of their
                armies in the field but of their economic and social way of life. It was an ageold nightmare
                come
                true,
                for
                early in Southern life whites in general and plantation owners in particular had begun to view
                the
                large
                number
                of slaves living among them as a potential threat to their property and their lives.<br>
                A series of bloody slave revolts in <span class="place state">Virginia</span> and other parts of the
                South resulted in the
                widespread
                practice of
                authorized night patrolscomposed of white men specially deputized for that purpose. White
                Southerners
                looked
                upon these night patrols as
                a civic duty, something akin to serving on a jury or in the militia. The mounted patrols, or
                regulators,
                as they
                were called, prowled Southern roads, enforcing the curfew for slaves, looking for runaways, and
                guarding
                rural
                areas against the threat of black uprisings. They were authorized by law to give a specific
                number
                of
                lashes to
                any violators they caught. The memory of these legal night riders and their whips was still
                fresh in
                the
                minds
                of both defeated Southerners and liberated blacks when the first Klansmen took to those same
                roads
                in
                <span class="date 1800">1866</span>.
            </p>
            <h2>Aftermath of War</h2>
            <p>An even more immediate impetus for the Ku Klux Klan was the <span class="event civilwar">
                    Civil
                    War
                </span>
                itself and the
                reconstruction that
                followed. When robed Klansmen were at their peak of power, alarmed Northerners justifiably
                saw
                in
                the
                Klan an
                attempt of unrepentant confederates to win through terrorism what they had been unable to
                win on
                the
                battlefield. Such a simple view did not totally explain the Klan’s sway over the South, but
                there is
                little
                doubt that many a confederate veteran exchanged his rebel gray for the hoods and sheets of
                the
                Invisible
                Empire.<br>
                Finally, and most importantly, there were the conditions Southerners were faced with
                immediately
                after
                the war.
                Their cities, plantations and farms were ruined; they were impoverished and often hungry;
                there
                was
                an
                occupation army in their midst; and reconstruction governments threatened to usurp the
                traditional
                white
                ruling
                authority. In the first few months after the fighting ended, white Southerners had to
                contend
                with
                the
                losses of
                life, property and, in their eyes, honor. The time was ripe for the Ku Klux Klan to ride.

            <p>The origin of the Ku Klux Klan was a carefully guarded secret for years, although there were
                many
                theories to
                explain its beginnings. One popular notion held that the Ku Klux Klan was originally a
                secret
                order
                of
                Chinese
                opium smugglers. Another claimed it was begun by Confederate prisoners during the war. the
                most
                ridiculous
                theory attributed the name to some ancient Jewish document referring to the hebrews enslaved
                by
                the
                Egyptian
                pharaohs. <br>In fact, the beginning of the Klan involved nothing so sinister, subversive or
                ancient
                as
                the
                theories
                supposed. it was the boredom of small-town life that led six young Confederate veterans to
                gather
                around
                a
                fireplace one December evening in <span class="date 1800">1865</span> and form a social
                club.
                The
                place
                was
                <span class="place tennessee pulaski">Pulaski, Tenn.</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulaski,_Tennessee" target="_blank"><span
                        class="material-symbols-outlined">

                    </span></a>, near the <span class="place state">Alabama</span>
                border. When they reassembled a week later, the six young men were full of ideas for their
                new
                society.
                It would
                be secret, to heighten the amusement of the thing, and the titles for the various offices
                were
                to
                have
                names as
                preposterous-sounding as possible, partly for the fun of it and partly to avoid any military
                or
                political
                implications. <br>Thus the head of the group was called the Grand
                    Cyclops.
                His
                assistant was the Grand Magi.
                There
                was to be a Grand Turk to greet all candidates for admission, a
                Grand Scribe to act as secretary, night
                    hawks
                for messengers and a Lictor to be the guard. the members, when
                the
                six
                young
                men
                found some to join, would be
                called Ghouls. But what to name the society itself?<br>
                The founders were determined to come up with something unusual and mysterious. Being
                well-educated,
                they
                turned
                to the Greek language. after tossing around a number of ideas, <span class="person reed">Richard
                    R.
                    Reed</span>
                suggested the word "kuklos", from
                which the english words "circle" and "cycle" are derived. another member, Capt. <span
                    class="person kennedy">John B.
                    Kennedy</span>, had an ear for
                alliteration and added the word "clan". after tinkering with the sound for a while they
                settled
                on
                Ku
                Klux
                Klan. the selection of the name, chance though it was, had a great deal to do with the
                Klan’s
                early
                success.
                Something about the sound aroused curiosity and gave the fledgling club an immediate air of
                mystery,
                as
                did the
                initials K.K.K., which were soon to take on such terrifying significance. <br> Soon after
                the
                founders
                named the
                Klan, they decided to do a bit of showing off, and so disguised themselves in sheets and
                galloped
                their
                horses
                through the quiet streets of tiny <span class="place pulaski">Pulaski</span>. Their
                ride
                created such a stir that the men
                decided
                to
                adopt
                the
                sheets as the official regalia of the Ku Klux Klan, and they added to the effect by donning
                grotesque
                masks and
                tall pointed hats. They also performed elaborate initiation ceremonies for new members.
                Similar
                to
                the
                hazing
                popular in college fraternities, the ceremony consisted of blindfolding the candidate,
                subjecting
                him to
                a
                series of silly oaths and rough handling, and finally bringing him before a "royal altar"
                where
                he
                was
                to be
                invested with a "royal crown". The altar turned out to be a mirror and the crown two large
                donkey’s
                ears.
                ridiculous though it sounds today, that was the high point of the earliest activities of the
                Ku
                Klux
                Klan.<br>
                Had
                that been all there was to the Ku Klux Klan, it probably would have disappeared as quietly
                as it
                was
                born. But
                at some point in early <span class="date 1800">1866</span>, the club added new members from
                nearby
                towns
                and
                began to
                have a chilling effect on
                local blacks. the intimidating night rides were soon the centerpiece of the hooded order:
                bands
                of
                white-sheeted
                ghouls paid late night visits to black homes, admonishing the terrified occupants to behave
                themselves
                and
                threatening more visits if they didn’t. it didn’t take long for the threats to be converted
                into
                violence
                against blacks who insisted on exercising their <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()">new
                    rights and
                    freedom</span>. Before its six founders
                realized
                what
                had happened, the Ku Klux Klan had become something they may not have originally intended —
                something
                deadly
                serious.

                months past when six young ex-confederates met in a law office in <span class="date 1800">December
                    1865</span>
                to
                form a secret club that they
                called the Ku Klux Klan. From that beginning in the little town of <span class="place pulaski">Pulaski, Tennessee</span>, their club began to grow.
                Historians disagree on the intention of the six founders, but it is known that word quickly
                spread
                about
                a new
                organization whose members met in secret and rode with their faces hidden, who practiced
                elaborate
                rituals and
                initiation ceremonies.<br> Much of the Klan’s early reputation may have been based on almost
                frivolous
                mischief
                and
                tomfoolery At first, a favorite Klan tactic had been for a white-sheeted Klansman wearing a
                ghoulish
                mask to
                ride up to a black family’s home at night and demand water. When the well bucket was
                offered,
                the
                Klansman would
                gulp it down and demand more, having actually poured the water through a rubber tube that
                flowed
                into a
                leather
                bottle concealed beneath his robe. After draining several buckets, the rider would exclaim
                that
                he
                had
                not had a
                drink since he died on the battlefield at <span class="event shiloh">Shiloh</span><a

                        link
                    </span></a>. He then
                galloped
                into the
                night,
                leaving the impression that
                ghosts of confederate dead were riding the countryside. <br> The presence of armed white men
                roving
                the
                countryside
                at night reminded many blacks of the pre-war slave patrols. The fact that Klansmen rode with
                their
                faces
                covered
                intensified blacks’ suspicion and fear. In time, the mischief turned to violence. Whippings
                were
                used
                first, but
                within months there were bloody clashes between Klansmen and blacks, Northerners who had
                come
                South,
                or
                Southern
                unionists. from the start, however, there was also a sinister side to the Klan.

                former
                rebel states had been
                rebuilt on astonishingly lenient terms which allowed
                many of the ex-confederate leaders to return to positions of power. Southern state
                legislatures
                began
                enacting
                laws that made it clear that the aristocrats who ran them intended to yield none of their
                pre-war
                power
                and
                dominance over poor whites and especially over blacks. These laws became known as the Black
                codes
                and in
                some
                cases amounted to a virtual re-enslavement of blacks.<br> In <span class="place state">Louisiana</span>,
                the Democratic
                convention
                resolved that
                <q>we
                    hold this to be a Government of White People, made and to be perpetuated for the
                    exclusive
                    benefit
                    of
                    the White
                    race, and ... that the people of African descent cannot be considered as citizens of the
                    United
                    States.</q>
                <span class="place state">Mississippi</span> and <span class="place state">Florida</span>,
                in particular, enacted vicious Black codes, other Southern states
                (except
                <span class="place state">North Carolina</span>) passed somewhat less severe versions,
                and

                nothing to prevent them from
                being enforced. <br> These laws and the hostility and violence that erupted against blacks
                and
                Union
                supporters
                in
                the South outraged Northerners who just a few months before had celebrated victory, not only
                over
                the
                confederacy but its system of slavery as well. In protest of the defiant Black codes,
                congress
                refused
                to seat
                the new Southern senators and representatives when it reconvened in <span class="date 1800">December
                    1865</span>
                after a long recess. At the
                moment the fledgling Klan was born in <span class="place pulaski">Pulaski</span>,
                the
                stage
                was set
                for a showdown
                between Northerners determined
                not to be cheated out of the fruits of their victory and die-hard Southerners who refused to
                give up
                their
                supremacy over blacks. <br>Ironically, the increasingly violent activities of the Klan
                throughout
                <span class="date 1800">1866</span> helped
                prove
                the argument of radical republicans in the North, who wanted harsher measures taken against
                Southern
                governments
                as part of their program to force equal treatment for blacks. Partly as a result of news
                reports
                of
                Klan
                violence in the South, the radicals won overwhelming victories in the congressional
                elections of
                <span class="date 1800">1866</span>. In early
                1867, they made a fresh start at reconstruction. In <span class="date 1800">March

                congress
                overrode
                <span class="person johnson">President Johnson</span>’s veto and
                passed the reconstruction Acts, which abolished the ex-confederate state governments and
                divided
                10
                of
                the 11
                former rebel states into military districts. The military governors of these districts were
                charged
                with
                enrolling black voters and holding elections for new constitutional conventions in each of
                the
                10
                states, which
                led to the creation of the radical reconstruction Southern governments.

                chose
                white
                sheets for
                their costumes. The following story was told to her by a black resident of <span
                    class="place washington">Washington D.C.</span>, who heard the story
                from his ex- slave ancestors: “Back in those days they had little log cabins built around in
                a
                circle,
                around
                for the slaves. and the log cabins, they dabbed between two logs, they dabbed it with some
                mortar.
                And
                of course
                when that fall out, you could look out and see.
                But every, most every night along about eight or nine o’clock, this overseer would get on
                his
                white
                horse and
                put a sheet over him, and put tin cans to a rope and drag it around. and they told all the
                slaves,
                ‘now
                if you
                poke your head out doors after a certain time, monster of a ghost will get you.’ they peeped
                through
                and
                see
                that and never go out. they didn’t have to have any guards.” Fry
                said
                such
                disguises meant to scare slaves were
                common and that the first Klansmen, knowing this, naturally chose similar uniforms, often
                embellishing
                them with
                fake horns and paint around the lips and eyes. <br>Relying heavily on the oral testimony of
                contemporary
                blacks
                whose parents or grandparents were slaves, Fry concludes that
                many
                slaves
                were
                superstitious, with real fears of
                ghosts, "haints", and the supernatural. But she said most slaves knew when white slave
                owners
                and
                patrollers
                were trying to fool them. one ex-slave told a Federal writer’s project interviewer during
                the
                <span class="date 1800">1930s</span>, <q>ha! ha!
                    dey jest talked ‘bout ghosts till i could hardly sleep at night, but the biggest thing in
                    ghosts
                    is
                    somebody
                    ‘guised up tryin’ to skeer you. ain’t no sich thing as ghosts.</q> another former slave
                reported,
                <q>Dey
                    ghost dere —
                    we seed ‘em. Dey’s w’ite people wid a sheet on ‘em to scare de slaves offen de plantation.</q>
                <br>According to
                Fry’s
                research, slaves may have been frightened by the slave patrols, but they were far from
                defenseless.
                A
                common
                trick of the patrollers was to dress in black except for white boots and a white hat, which
                did
                make
                a
                ghostly
                sight when a group of them were riding along on a dark night. on one such occasion, however,
                slaves
                stretched
                grapevines across the road at just the right height to strike a rider on horseback. The
                slave
                patrol
                came
                galloping along and hit the grapevines; three patrollers were killed and several others
                injured.
                there
                were no
                more mounted slave patrols for a long time afterwards in that county. <br>After the <span
                    class="event civilwar"> Civil
                    War </span>, when the Ku Klux
                Klan
                served the same purpose of controlling blacks as the slave patrols had, many whites (and
                later
                historians)
                mistook the surface behavior of blacks for their genuine feelings. For blacks, Fry says, “appearing to
                believe
                what whites wanted them to believe was a part of wearing the mask and playing the game ...
                in
                another
                instance,
                on exslave who heard rumors of strange riders in his neighborhood went to his former master
                for
                information.

            Congressional
            committee’s
            report, this informant gave the matter considerable thought and rejected it. in his own
            words:
            <q>i
                studied about
                it, but i did not believe it.</q>
            Fry continues, <q>it is
                significant
                that the
                early Klan made such great
                efforts to
                frighten and terrorize blacks through supernatural means. The whole rationale for
                psychological
                control
                based on
                a fear of the supernatural was that whites were sure that they knew black people. They were
                not
                only
                firmly
                convinced that black people were gullible and would literally believe anything, but they
                were
                equally
                sure that
                blacks were an extremely superstitious people who had a fantastic belief in the supernatural
                interwoven
                into
                their life, folklore, and religion.</q><br> <q>Such thinking had obvious flaws: the
                    underestimation of
                    black
                    intelligence
                    and the overvaluation of existing superstitious beliefs. Blacks were frightened, no doubt,
                    but
                    not
                    of
                    ghosts.
                    they were terrified of living, well-armed men who were extremely capable of making black

                <h2>Ghost Riders</h2>
                <p>In <span class="date 1800">April 1867</span>, a call went out for all known Ku Klux Klan
                    chapters
                    or
                    dens
                    to send
                    representatives to <span class="place tennessee nashville">Nashville, Tenn.</span>, for a meeting
                    that would plan, among other things, the Klan response to
                    the
                    new
                    federal

                    had
                    by this time joined the
                    Klan. Many now viewed the escalating violence with growing alarm — not necessarily because
                    they
                    had
                    sympathy for
                    the victims, but because the night riding was getting out of their control. Anyone
                    could put on a sheet and a mask and ride into the night to commit assault, robbery, rape,
                    arson
                    or
                    murder. The
                    Klan was increasingly used as a cover for common crime or for personal revenge. <br>The
                    <span class="place tennessee nashville">Nashville</span> Klan
                    convention
                    was called to grapple with these problems by creating a chain of command and deciding just
                    what
                    sort
                    of
                    organization the Klan would be. The meeting gave birth to the official philosophy of white
                    supremacy
                    as
                    the
                    fundamental creed of the Ku Klux Klan. Throughout the summer of <span class="date 1800">1867</span>
                    the
                    Invisible
                    empire changed, shedding the
                    antics that had brought laughter during its parades and other public appearances, and
                    instead
                    taking
                    on
                    the full

                <h2>The Klan’s Version of History</h2>
                <p>Few eras of United States history are as entangled in myth and legend as the period of <span
                        class="date 1800">1865</span> to <span class="date 1800">1877</span>, known as the
                    reconstruction. For the modern Klansman, this period of history is vitally important, and
                    the
                    retelling
                    of the
                    events of those days is a basic element of Klan propaganda. <br>The Klan version of
                    reconstruction
                    goes
                    like
                    this:
                    in the dark days immediately after the <span class="event civilwar"> Civil War </span>,
                    Southerners
                    were
                    just
                    beginning
                    to pick up the pieces of their
                    shattered lives when an evil and profit-minded coalition of northern radical republicans,
                    carpetbaggers
                    and
                    Southern scalawags threw out legitimate Southern governments at bayonet point and began
                    installing
                    illiterate
                    blacks in state offices. worse, the conspirators aroused mobs of savage blacks to attack
                    defenseless
                    whites
                    while the South was helpless to do anything about it. the radicals pulling the strings
                    behind
                    the
                    scenes
                    stole
                    Southern state governments blind and sent them deeply into debt. after a few years of this,
                    the
                    Ku
                    Klux
                    Klan
                    arose, drove out the carpetbaggers and radicals and restored white Southerners to their
                    rightful
                    place
                    in their
                    own land.<br> Like all legends and myths, this particular scenario starts out with a few
                    grains
                    of
                    truth, but
                    winds
                    up being a romanticized story, a version of history that white Southerners in the <span

                        1800s</span> wanted very badly
                    to believe was true.<br> No events of this period illustrate the inaccuracy of the legend
                    better
                    than
                    the race
                    riots
                    which occurred in <span class="place memphis">Memphis</span> and <span class="place norleans">New Orleans</span>
                    in the first
                    half of <span class="date 1800">1866</span>. In both cases,
                    white city police attacked
                    groups of
                    blacks without provocation and killed scores of men, women and children with the help of
                    armed
                    white
                    mobs behind
                    them. these were the worst incidents of white organized violence against blacks in that
                    year,
                    but by
                    no
                    means
                    the only ones.<br> The next phase of the story concerns the reconstruction governments that
                    were
                    installed in
                    <span class="date 1800">1867</span>
                    after Congress abolished the renegade governments formed by the ex-Confederate states
                    immediately
                    after
                    the war.

                Some of these newly formed governments were indeed corrupt and incompetent, as white
                supremacists
                maintain. But
                historians who have studied these governments have found that often the
                greatest beneficiaries of the corruption were aristocratic white Southerners. One
                historian
                summed
                up the
                radical governments this way: <q>Granting all their mistakes, the radical governments were by
                    far
                    the
                    most
                    democratic the South had ever known. they were the only governments in Southern history to
                    extend to
                    n*****s
                    <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()">complete civil and political

                    and
                    to try to protect them in
                    the enjoyment of the rights
                    they
                    were
                    granted.</q> and when these governments were replaced by all-white conservative governments,
                most
                of
                these
                rights
                were stripped away from blacks and in some cases from poor whites as well.<br> The
                restoration
                of
                white
                government
                in the South was called “redemption,” and although there are many historical reasons for the
                change,
                it
                was a
                development for which the Klan claimed credit, thereby placing the secret society in what it
                viewed
                as a
                heroic
                role in Southern history.

                    Klan was found strung up in a tree, his feet just barely touching the ground. Later another

                    was
                    stripped and

                    sympathy and
                    support of most white citizens often behind it, the
                    Klan
                    worked behind a veil that was impossible for <span class="person brownlow">Brownlow</span>
                    and

                    though a large majority of white Southerners opposed the radical state governments, not all
                    of
                    them
                    approved of
                    the hooded order’s brand of vigilante justice. During its first year, the Klan’s public

                    and
                    parades were
                    sometimes hooted and jeered at by townspeople who looked upon them as a joke. Later, when
                    the
                    Klan
                    began
                    to use
                    guns and whips to make its point, some white newspaper editors, ministers and other civic
                    leaders
                    spoke
                    out

                    the
                    Klan were in the minority.
                    One of

                <h2>The KKK’s first death</h2>
                <p>As the violence escalated, it turned to general lawlessness, and some Klan groups even began
                    fightingeach
                    other.
                    In <span class="place nashville">Nashville</span>, a gang of outlaws who adopted
                    the
                    Klan
                    disguise
                    came to be known as the
                    Black Ku Klux Klan. For
                    several months middle<span class="place state">Tennessee</span> was
                    plagued by a guerrilla war
                    between the real and bogus Klans.<br> The Klan was also coming under increased attack by
                    Congress
                    and
                    the
                    Reconstruction state governments. The leaders of the Klan thus realized that the order’s end
                    was
                    at
                    hand, at
                    least as any sort of organized force to serve their interests. It is widely believed that
                    <span class="person forrest">Forrest</span> ordered the
                    Klan disbanded in <span class="date 1800">January 1869</span>, but the surviving document is
                    rather
                    ambiguous.
                    (Some
                    historians think <span class="person forrest">Forrest</span>’s
                    "order" was just a trick so he could deny responsibility or knowledge of Klan
                    atrocities.)<br>

                    actual
                    date, it is clear that as an organized, cohesive body across the South, the Ku Klux Klan had
                    ceased
                    to
                    exist by
                    the end of <span class="date 1800">1869</span>. <br> That did not end the violence, however,
                    and
                    as
                    atrocities
                    became
                    more widespread, Radical
                    legislatures throughout the region began to pass very restrictive laws, impose martial law
                    in
                    some
                    Klandominated
                    counties, and actively hunt Klan leaders.
                    In <span class="date 1800">1871</span>, Congress held hearings on the Klan and passed a
                    harsh
                    anti-Klan
                    law
                    modeled
                    after a <span class="place state">North Carolina</span>
                    statute. Under the new federal law, Southerners lost their jurisdiction over the crimes of
                    assault,
                    robbery and
                    murder, and the president was authorized to declare martial law and suspend the writ of
                    habeas
                    corpus.
                    Nightriding and the wearing of masks were expressly prohibited. Hundreds of Klansmen were
                    arrested,
                    but
                    few
                    actually went to prison.<br> The laws probably dampened the enthusiasm for the Ku Klux Klan,
                    but
                    they
                    can hardly
                    be
                    credited with destroying the hooded order. By the <span class="date 1800">mid 1870s</span>,
                    white
                    Southerners
                    didn’t
                    need the Klan as much as
                    before because they had by that time retaken control of most Southern state governments.
                    Klan
                    terror
                    had
                    proven
                    very effective at keeping black voters away from the polls. Some black officeholders were
                    hanged
                    and
                    many more
                    were brutally beaten. White Southern Democrats won elections easily and then passed laws
                    taking
                    away
                    the
                    rights
                    blacks had won during <span class="event reconstruction">Reconstruction</span>.<br> The
                    result was
                    an official system of segregation
                    which
                    was
                    the
                    law of
                    the
                    land for more than 80 years. This system was called “separate but equal,” which was half
                    true —
                    everything was
                    separate, but nothing was equal.

                <h2>Born Again</h2>
                <p>During the <span class="date 1800">last half of 19th Century</span>, memories of the Ku Klux
                    Klan’s
                    brief
                    grip on
                    the
                    South faded, and its
                    bloody deeds were forgotten by many whites who were once in sympathy with its cause. On the
                    national
                    scene, two
                    events served to set the stage for the Ku Klux Klan to be reborn <span class="date 1900">early
                        in
                        the
                        20th
                        Century</span>.<br> The first was
                    massive <span class="event immigration">immigration</span>, bringing some 23 million people
                    from
                    <span class="place state">Great Britain</span>, <span class="place state">Germany</span>,
                    <span class="place state">Italy</span>, <span class="place state">Hungary</span>, and <span
                        class="place state">Russia</span> and
                    a great cry of opposition from some Americans. The American Protective Association,
                    organized in
                    <span class="date 1800">1887</span>, reflected
                    the attitude of many Americans who believed that the nation was being swamped by alien
                    people.
                    This
                    organization, a secret, oathbound group, was especially strong in the Middle West, where the
                    reborn
                    Ku
                    Klux Klan
                    would later draw much of its strength.<br> The other major event which prepared the ground
                    for
                    the
                    Klan’s return
                    was
                    <span class="event ww1">World War I</span>, which had a wrenching, unsettling effect on the
                    nation.
                    On
                    the
                    European
                    battlefields, white
                    Americans again were exposed to unrestrained bloodshed while blacks served in the uniform of
                    their
                    country and
                    saw open up before them a new world.
                    Back at home, Americans learned suspicion, hatred and
                    distrust
                    of
                    anything
                    alien, a sentiment which led to the rejection of <span class="person wilson">President

                    another series of events occurred which helped breathe life into the Klan several decades
                    later.

                    In
                    the
                    <span class="date 1800">1890s</span>,
                    an agrarian Populist movement tried to build a coalition of blacks and poor whites against
                    the
                    mill
                    owners,
                    large landholders and conservative elite of the Old South. The aristocracy responded with
                    the
                    old
                    cry of
                    white
                    supremacy and the manipulation of black votes. As a result, the Populists were substantially
                    turned
                    back
                    in
                    every Deep South state except <span class="place state">Georgia</span> and <span
                        class="place state">North Carolina</span>.
                    A feeling spread across the South, shared by both the
                    aristocracy and many poor whites, that blacks had to be frozen out of society.<br> The <span
                        class="date 1800">1890s</span> marked the
                    beginning of
                    efforts in the Deep South to deny political, social and
                    economic
                    power
                    to
                    blacks. Most
                    segregation and
                    disenfranchisement laws date from that period. It was also the beginning of a series of
                    lynchings of
                    blacks by
                    white mobs. The combination of legalized racism and the constant threat of violence
                    eventually
                    led
                    to
                    major
                    black migration to Northern cities.
