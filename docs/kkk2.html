        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p><span class="maiuscoletto">THE KU KLUX KLAN</span> has seen as its mission the preservation of the
                institutionalized caste pattern of the South and the promotion of a
                patriotic ideology. Despite continuity in this mission and the preservation
                of elaborate rituals over the years, the Klan has undergone a change in
                its tactics and targets and can no longer be considered a viable social
                movement. <br>
                The history of the Klan falls into three periods. Following the <span class="event civilwar">Civil
                    War</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" target="_blank"><span
                        class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>, the Klan was created to meet the threat posed by the newly freed
                slaves. Convinced that it had succeeded in preserving the antebellum
                South, the hooded knights vanished. Another war, the <span class="event ww1">First World
                    War</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" target="_blank"><span
                        class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>,
                brought the Ku Klux Klan back to deal with a host of changes in the
                "American Way", including <span class="event immigration">immigration</span> of aliens to the United
                States
                and migration from the rural South to the Northern cities by black people. Combination of corruption
                within
                the organization and a feeling that some stability had been achieved in the society brought the
                "second
                Klan" abruptly to an end. The third period saw the resurrection of the
                Klan in response to the threat posed by the Supreme Court decisions of
                the fifties. A fragmented ghost of the past, the contemporary Ku Klux
                Klan continues to wage its fight against evildoers. <br>
                After examining the history of the Klan, two hypotheses emerge. The
                first is that although racism is the Klan's mainstay, the specific targets and tactics of its
                propaganda
                have varied, reflecting societal change. William Bruce Cameron,
                sociology professor at the
                University of
                South
                Florida, stated that the Ku Klux Klan is the classic example of a movement
                which has been reborn and that each rebirth has been marked by differences in purposes and in
                methods.<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> Mayer N. Zald and
                Robert Asch main-
                tain that changing conditions in the society increase or decrease the po-
                tential support base of a movement.<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup> Consequently, Klan
                tactics have
                been altered to maximize support and to ensure a large following without forsaking the Klan's
                mission.<br>
                The second hypothesis is that the Ku Klux Klan has changed in the
                hundred years of its existence from a social movement to a mentality. A movement denotes a large
                number
                of
                people banding together for the express purpose of changing individuals or societal
                institutions.<sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> A klan
                mentality refers to an acceptance of
                what has been the Klan without identifying oneself with the Ku Klux Klan or
                without being aware that one's prejudices form the core of Klan thinking. not to say that the Klan
                created
                racism. Rather, it is to say that the ending of the Ku Klux Klan did not signal the end of racist
                thinking.<sup><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></sup> This was
                true in the <span class="date 1900">thirties </span>and <span class="date 1900">forties</span>.
                Despite
                the collapse of

                hysteria, the immigration based on Nordic supremacy remained.<sup><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a></sup>
                Similarly, a
                more
                accurate
                ment of the contemporary Klan
                leads one to the conclusion that no longer an effective and viable force in American life, the klan
                mentality
                remains, if not thrives, today.<br>
                Besides the two theories which appear in this analysis, an examination will be made of the
                composition
                of
                the Klan, which has to tent varied depending upon the stated goals

                methodological
                problems
                that had to be faced. Those were strongly anti-Klan degraded Klansmen; an instance is Frederick

                        class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>'s statement that the Klan provided "a chance to dress village bigot and let
                him
                be a knight of
                the Invisible Empire."<sup><a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a></sup> Members and friends of the Klan
                portrayed it as
                a
                fraternal
                organization of professional men,
                ministers, and civic leaders. To go beyond the statement that the truth lies in between these two
                descriptions becomes very difficult with a group that prides itself on secrecy. Government
                investigations,
                writings of ex-Klan members, and the few academic pieces on the subject appear at times to raise
                more
                questions
                than they have answered. Within this framework of
                frequently emotional writing and incomplete and often purposefully inaccurate statements, general
                conclusions,
                let
                alone specific postulates on Klan composition, become a challenge.

            <h2>The Reconstruction Klan</h2>
            <p>Klan organizations have consistently looked to the past and commemorated the achievements
                accomplished by their
                forerunners. Usually
                Klansmen trace their history to the time when a Confederate Army General, <span

                    Forrest</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest" target="_blank"><span

                    </span></a>, headed an
                organization called the Ku Klux
                Klan in nine Southern states.<sup><a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a></sup> The idea for the name, the
                importance of
                sworn
                secrecy, and the use of bedsheets
                as a disguise came from activities of a handful of Confederate Army
                veterans in <span class="date 1800">1865</span> at <span class="place state">Tennessee</span>.
                Since
                reportedly the
                purpose
                of these veterans was pure amusement, the Ku Klux
                Klan in the sense of a movement or organization began in <span class="date 1800">1867</span>.
                <br>
                Contrary to the legends which have persisted over the years, the Klan
                was relatively short-lived during <span class="event reconstruction">Reconstruction</span>. It
                actually lasted
                as a
                formal organization only two years, until <span class="date 1800">1869</span>, when <span
                    class="person forrest">Forrest</span> disbanded
                it. As indicated in his testimony before the Joint Select Committee on the
                Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, he formed the
                Klan to deal with the animosity that existed between the Union and the
                rebel soldiers and the apprehension of violence from the newly freed
                slaves.<sup><a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a></sup> The substitution of military governments for the
                locally
                created
                governments called for in the Reconstruction Act of March, <span class="date 1800">1867</span>,
                became
                the signal for the start of the Klan as an organization. The Klan became
                fairly successful in undermining the actions of the Radical Republicans
                in Congress by intimidating the freed slaves to keep them from voting. It
                was in their role as citizens that black men became the target of Klan
                vengeance. As history professor David Chalmers<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mark_Chalmers" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a> points out, the lack of
                overt militia violence on the part of the freed slaves suggests the conclusion that Klansmen
                were
                striking
                against the freed slaves as voters and
                officeholders and not as lawbreakers.<sup><a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></sup> The Klan struck
                against real or
                perceived resentment by the former slaves and quickly mobilized at the
                scattered signs of blacks achieving economic success.<br>
                The composition of the Klan changed quickly. Initially it was composed of the better citizens of
                the
                South. Soon
                it became popular among
                those elements in the former Confederate States whose status was less
                differentiated from the freed slaves- <q>the pore no'count white trash</q>.
                Seeing his secret order becoming a salvage pile for the undesirable elements of society, <span
                    class="person forrest">Forrest</span> moved to
                disband it in <span class="date 1800">1869</span>. Despite the formal
                attempt to end the movement, nightriding Klansmen were active until
                <span class="date 1800">1877</span>. Several explanations have been given for the eventual
                decline
                of
                the Ku Klux Klan of the <span class="event reconstruction">Reconstruction</span><a

                Although
                public
                sentiment grew against
                its violence and federal
                legislation curbed its activities
                to some extent, the reason for the Klan's demise in <span class="date 1800">1877</span> is much
                simpler.
                The Klan for all intents had accomplished its purpose.<sup><a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a></sup>

                The Klan had begun its second phase. <br>
                <span class="person simmons">Simmons</span>, as this century's first <span class="roles">Imperial
                    Wizard</span>,
                expanded alistic elements of the Reconstruction Klan to create
                an autocratic hierarchy of officials, an elaborate ritual and a detailed array of regalia. The
                hierarchy listed such officers of the <span class="roles">klavern</span>(a local chapter) as the
                <span class="roles">kludd</span>(chaplain), <span class="roles">kligrapp</span>(secretary), <span
                    class="roles">klaragoo</span>, <span class="roles">klexter</span>, and <span
                    class="roles">nighthawk</span>
                (guards). Such an obsession with ritual and titles prompted the historian
                Richard Hofstadter to note that the Klan set up a secret
                organization
                that
                in some ways flattered its opponents-e.g., the priestly garments of
                Roman Catholicism and the secret cells of the Communist Party.<sup><a href="#footnote-13">[13]</a></sup>
                All
                this ritual and use of impressive titles was not without purpose. The status-exalting nomenclature
                and rituals
                helped the Klansmen to set themselves apart from the mass of humanity and to become an indispensable
                part of the Invisible Empire. As one author suggested, <q>When a man joins
                    the Ku Klux Klan, a sensation seems to come over him as definite as falling in love. He simply

                    class="person clarke">Clarke</span>'s
                publicity got a
                healthy boost by an extensive series
                in the <span class="place ny">New York</span> World in <span class="date 1900">September of
                    1921</span> "exposing" Klan activities.
                Carried in eighteen newspapers mentioned throughout the press, the articles appeared to do more to
                arouse
                people's curiosity than their opposition.<sup><a href="#footnote-15">[15]</a></sup><br>
                Clearly the publicity and organizational experts had to have with existing prejudices. In order to
                create an
                organization with million members, according to some estimates, the Klan officials have capitalized
                on real
                fears. The years following <span class="event ww1">World War</span> marked by an emotional letdown.
                The
                heightened patriotism that war brought
                continued after the <span class="event armistice">Armistice</span><a

                    </span></a>. The <span class="event ww1">War</span> was followed hysteria that accompanied the
                <span class="event wallstreet">Wall Street bombing</span> and the
                fear Bolsheviks. Coupled with these relatively distant concerns were real ones of <span
                    class="event migration">migration</span>, primarily of
                Southern blacks to the urban of the North. The immigrants that had been coming to America posed a
                threat rather
                than a promise. Many Americans saw their life being changed. The League of Nations, "N***o
                upptiness,"
                cosmopolitanism, unhindered immigration all signaled the death of the old can way.<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-16">[16]</a></sup> The Reconstruction Klan had
                responded to the perceived
                threat posed by the North and the freed slaves. Similarly, the Knights the Ku Klux Klan following
                <span class="event ww1">World War I</span>
                responded to different reflecting the changes in the larger society. As the forces of change so did
                the Klan's
                reaction against them. It became anti-Catholic of Protestant, anti-alien instead of pro-American.
                The propaganda
                throughout the country-anti-Japanese in the Pacific states, anti-in the Atlanic states, and
                anti-Mexican in the
                Southwest. The fered a target for every frustration. <br>
                Clearly the Klan had as its targets imaginary as well as real. For example, the state of <span
                    class="place state">Oregon</span> in <span class="date 1900">1922</span> had over
                25,000 Klan despite the fact that its population was 97 percent Caucasian, 85 native born American
                (balance from
                Canada), 92 percent Protestant, illiteracy was almost nonexistent. Nevertheless, by a combination
                lation,
                wartime tradition of suspicion and inquisitiveness, Prohibition,
                and superior salesmanship, a thriving Klan was created. The speed which the Klan took over the state
                is apparent
                in the statement Klan grew from nothing in <span class="date 1900">1921</span> to a force
                controlling <span class="place state">Oregon</span>
                politics <span class="date 1900">1922</span>. By <span class="date 1900">1923</span> the Ku Klux
                Klan had elected both the President State Senate and the Speaker of the House.<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-17">[17]</a></sup> At
                other times and the threats
                were much more real. In <span class="place chicago">Chicago</span>, the Ku Klux Klan was strongest
                on the South
                Side,
                particularly in <span class="place  kenwood">Kenwood</span>, <span class="place hyde">Hyde Woodlawn</span>
                , <span class="place sshore">South Shore</span>, and <span class="place englewood">Englewood</span>.
                These areas of the city
                spond closely to the sections which felt the
                political pressure of the Roman Catholics and second generation immigrants, and the pressure exerted
                by the
                rapid influx of blacks into an ever-expanding Black Belt.<sup><a href="#footnote-18">[18]</a></sup>
                <br>
                As indicated above, Frederick Lewis Allen equated Klansmen with
                the village bigot. Yet the Klan at this time thrived in the University of
                Chicago area of <span class="place hyde">Hyde Park</span> and klaverns were established at Harvard
                and Princeton.<sup><a href="#footnote-19">[19]</a></sup> To many native born Protestants, Catholics,
                Jews, and
                blacks posed more of a threat than did the Invisible Empire. A few non-
                random samples exist of the occupational background of the Klan in the
                <span class="date 1900">1920</span>'s. The Knox County No. 14 in <span
                    class="place knoxville">Knoxville, Tennessee</span>, in
                <span class="date 1900">1927</span> had 399
                members, of whom 29 percent were white-collar workers.<sup><a href="#footnote-20">[20]</a></sup>
                Tolerance, a
                magazine aimed at exposing the Klan, listed 110 members of the <span class="date 1900">1922</span>
                Chicago Klan, of whom 61 percent were white-collar workers. Despite
                the fact that the latter figures are biased toward the professionals since it
                was to the advantage of Tolerance to expose high status individuals, the
                Klan apparently had good representation of all segments of native born
                white Protestants. As to what social group formed the bulk of Klan membership, Kenneth T. Jackson <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_T._Jackson" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>, upon examination of the above data
                and
                analysis of similar statistics from <span class="place denver">Denver</span>, <span
                    class="place indianapolis">Indianapolis</span>,
                and <span class="place anaheim">Anaheim</span>,
                concludes "that in the city the secret order was a lower-class movement."<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-21">[21]</a></sup><br>
                This leads to a second question concerning the composition of the
                Klan-was it a rural or an urban phenomenon? Mecklin concluded that:
                "The Klan is essentially a village and small-town organization. Neither
                the great city with its hodgepodge of races and groups nor the country
                with its isolation lends itself to effective Klan organization."<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> To
                say
                that an organization which resisted alien threats was more urban or rural
                is to maintain that one part of the nation had a monopoly on prejudice.
                The Invisible Empire although not strong everywhere attracted wide-
                spread support among farmers, townspeople, and city dwellers of many
                states. <br>
                Undoubtedly the most controversial aspect of the Ku Klux Klan is the
                tactics it employs. For the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the violent nightridings were only a small
                part. The
                boycotting of business-those which
                were Jewish-owned or those having some minimal type of integration
                among the employees or customers- was a frequently successful method
                for the Klan in achieving its goals. Imperial Wizard<span
                    class="person simmons">Simmons</span> often used the phrase
                vocational Klanishness, which
                meant the <q>Trading, with and patronizing Klansmen in preference to all
                    others.</q> <sup><a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a></sup>It was always to the benefit of the Klan
                to
                make
                it seem to
                those
                outside visible Empire that it was larger than
                it actually was. Parades, burnings, and other mass public demonstrations helped it to purpose. In
                <span class="date 1900">August of
                    1925</span>, <span class="place washington">Washington D.C.</span> hosted a parade of tens sands
                of
                Klansmen that
                lasted
                three and a half hours. The publicity
                came out of such shows of strength aided the Klan as it drew icans into the Invisible Empire. <br>
                Violence as the collective activity of a local Klavern's members curred frequently in the <span
                    class="date 1900">1920's</span>. For example,
                from <span class="date 1900">October, 1920, to October, 1921</span>, the Klan was implicated,
                although not
                necessarily in four killings, a mutilation,
                one branding with acid, five kidnappings,
                forty-two floggings, and twenty-seven tar and feather parties.<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-24">[24]</a></sup>In
                looking at the
                role of violence, it is valuable to go
                beyond the initial ments made by those who opposed the Klan. Rather than being open-minded,
                opposition to the
                Klan in the <span class="date 1900">1920's</span> was often only against its use of violence, with
                the
                opponents occasionally guage
                just as
                bigoted as the Klan. Fry argued that <q>experience that the two
                    races
                    get along
                    better when they are segregated,</q>
                he conceded the Klan should not bring this about. <q>Rather</q>, he said, <q>come through an
                    enlightenment of
                    public
                    opinion.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-25">[25]</a></sup> Similarly Bohn
                in
                the American Journal of Sociology saw the Klan as cruel, but he also saw
                <q>barbaric and totally illiterate N***o slaves</q> coupled with immigrants
                who <q>have been invited to join us and hastily receive all the rights and
                    privileges of citizenship</q> as posing real threats to America.<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-26">[26]</a></sup>
                A
                former
                Klan member summarized this when he wrote that <q>much of the opposi-
                    tion against the Klan was not so much based upon the Klan's activity
                    against the N***o as it was against the Klan's assumption that it su-
                    perseded the law.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-27">[27]</a></sup> <br>
                Another method used by the Klan of the 1920's was involvement in
                regular party politics. Never before and not since has the Ku Klux Klan
                been such a significant force in politics on all levels of government. As
                Klansmen or pro-Klan candidates got elected to governorships and even
                to the national Congress, the influence was bound to be felt at the na-
                tional level. It was felt, for example, at the <span class="date 1900">1924</span>Democratic
                Convention,
                which saw an anti-Klan plank defeated after a prolonged, heated debate.<sup><a
                        href="#footnote-28">[28]</a></sup> But only
                four years later, the Democrats nominated <span class="person smith">Al Smith</span><a
                    href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Smith" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>. As Charles
                    Alexander perceptively noted,
                <q><span class="person smith">Al Smith</span>, son of Irish grants, represented everything the Klan,
                    and
                    perhaps most rural-Protestant Americans detested- <span class="place ny">New York</span> City,
                    Tammany Hall, Catholicism,
                    foreignism.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-29">[29]</a></sup> Even
                though <span class="person smith">Smith</span> was defeated for the presidency, merely his
                nomination
                represented a
                significant political set-back for
                the Klan. When the contemporary Ku Klux Klan is discussed later in the paper, the involvement of
                Klansmen in
                local will be
                analyzed. In no respect does the group's current flirtation politics compare to the influence once
                wielded by
                the Knights. <br>
                There is little question that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan time were a powerul force which
                appeared to
                permeate every American life. One only has to turn to the Lynds' analysis of <span
                    class="place muncie">Muncie,Indiana</span>. They note that <q>one

                    longer.' </q><sup><a href="#footnote-30">[30]</a></sup> Before too long, there appeared growing

            <h2>The Klan Fades Away for the Second Time</h2>
            <p>The <span class="date 1900">1930</span>'s brought new targets of Klan propaganda. It also
                ultimately
                brought the end of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Soon after election, a number of states
                adopted
                antimask
                laws in an effort Klan violence. However, two other reasons are more significant drop in
                membership
                internal
                struggles and the exposure of among top officials.<br>
                The Klan hierarchical structure dictated that Klansmen were their immediate leader and the other
                officials up
                the chain of They were to follow without question the decrees, commands, structions" that were
                given
                them.<sup><a href="#footnote-31">[31]</a></sup> With
                the prize huge amounts money in the form of initiation fees, dues, special assessments, backs
                from
                the
                production of robes, a number of power plays the organization that shook the very foundations of
                the
                movement.
                At the same time that internal dissension weakened the hierarchy, the pers regularly told of
                corruption
                and
                even
                immorality of certain leaders. The leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in <span
                    class="place state">Indiana</span>, <span class="person stephenson">Stephenson</span>, was
                convicted in <span class="date 1900">1926</span> of the murder and rape of girl.<sup><a

                Members of the Klan who by
                their oath were dedicated
                righteousness found this too difficult to accept and left the Empire. <br>
                In the midst of scandal and in-fighting, Indiana's <span class="person colescott">James A.

                in
                <span class="date 1900">June of 1939</span>. Immediately the new aim of the organization became
                to
                <q>mop up the cesspools of communism in the United States.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a></sup>
                Needless to
                say for the
                Klansmen communism was
                present in the NAACP Congress of Industrial Organizations, and was supported
                by money the Jewish community. For example, in <span class="place state">South Carolina</span>,
                organizers
                the Textile Workers Union of America
                were fair game for Klansmen, and in neighboring <span class="place atlanta">Atlanta</span>
                thirty-two union
                leaders whipped. The underlying reason
                for the anti-unionism was equal pay concept behind union organizations. Consequently, would
                receive
                no more pay
                than a black member of the same the same work.<sup><a href="#footnote-34">[34]</a></sup> What
                might
                have been
                the high
                point in anti-Semitism was
                reached in <span class="date 1900">1940</span>, when the Knights became involved in the
                German-American Bund. In
                August of that burning
                Klansmen appeared side-by-side with swastika-bearing men at a rally on the 205-acre Camp
                Nordlund
                near <span class="place njersey andover">Andover,New Jersey</span>. Despite the presence of the
                Imperial Wizard himself wedding at the rally,
                Colescott later
                attempted
                to
                repudiate amidst the unfavorable response it received.<sup><a href="#footnote-35">[35]</a></sup>
                <br>
                The organization known as the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,Inc. officially dissolved itself at an
                Imperial
                Klonvokation
                held in <span class="place atlanta">Atlanta</span> <span class="date 1900">April 23,
                    1944</span>.
                The immediate
                cause for its
                collapse was the suit for $685,305 in back taxes by
                the United States Bureau Revenue. The more significant cause was its inability to deal own
                success.
                If the Klan
                had grown more slowly and more cautiously, might have taken its place among other exclusive
                fraternities. it
                became subject to its own ineptness; and much like its Reconstruction
                ancestor, the Klan was undemocratic in organization and in decision-making, and uncontrollable
                in
                local action.
                The national leaders could not
                have controlled the violence and excesses in propaganda even if they had
                wished to.<sup><a href="#footnote-36">[36]</a></sup> <br>
                Despite the exposure of graft and the lack of a positive program, thousands of Americans clung
                to
                the Klan
                spirit; nevertheless, as a viable organization the Klan was dead. The few parades of hooded
                citizens
                of the
                Invisible Empire now held would bring jeers rather than cheers. Blacks,
                once afraid of these symbols of white supremacy, would line the parade
                route and shout, <q>Send us your sheets, white folks, we'll wash'em!</q><sup><a
                        href="#footnote-37">[37]</a></sup>
                Once a special order to which the politicians and businessmen flocked to
                gain dignity, it had become a pariah to be shunned by the same men. But
                though the prestige of the Klan was gone, the attitudes which formed its
                mentality were still very much alive.

            <h2>Fragments of the Klan</h2>
            <p>In <span class="date 1900">1946</span>, <span class="person green">Samuel Green, Sr.</span>, an
                <span class="place atlanta">Atlanta</span> obstretrician, resurrected the old Association of
                Georgia
                Klans.
                Unwilling
                to recharter the Knights which he was a klavern head because of the
                back taxes due, he attempted
                to create a nationwide organization. By the time of his death three years later, it was clear
                that
                Green had
                failed
                miserably in this purpose. In <span class="date 1900">1953</span>, <span class="person edwards">Eldon
                    Lee Edwards</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldon_Edwards" target="_blank"><span
                        class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a> chartered
                the
                US Klans of
                <span class="place state">Georgia</span> in a attempt at Klan return
                of the post-war period. Despite his failure ganize outside the South, he and the Supreme Court
                decision on
                schools of <span class="date 1900">May, 1954</span>, laid the groundwork for the contemporary
                Klan.
                <br>
                Today's Ku Klux Klan is marked by fragmentation and the failure its leaders to agree on a common
                course of
                action in response to selected issues. In reality it is several organizations. The House
                Committee
                on
                Un-American Activities identifies fourteen separate groups ranging in membership from only 25 to
                over 15,000
                dues-paying Klansmen.<sup><a href="#footnote-38">[38]</a></sup>
                The Klan movement has been a victim of inter-group rivalry with always
                at least three groups competing for power since <span class="date 1900">1949</span>. Sometimes
                the
                dispute has
                been
                over tactics, such as the
                use of burning crosses to intimidate
                prospective black voters. More often it has appeared as simply a personality conflict or a
                struggle
                for control.
                Rather than examining all the various Klans, it is more fruitful to concentrate on the group
                with
                the largest
                following. <br>
                The largest contemporary Klan group is the United Klans of America
                (UKA) operating out of headquarters in <span class="place tuscaloosa">Tuscaloosa, Alabama</span>,
                under
                the
                front of the "Alabama Rescue Service." Since <span class="date 1900">1961</span> its Imperial
                    Wizard
                has been <span class="person schelton">Robert Shelton</span>, a former rubber plant worker, who
                holds this
                post despite his serving a sentence in Texarkana Prison for contempt of
                Congress before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<sup><a href="#footnote-39">[39]</a></sup>
                Very
                recently there have been significant signs that the UKA's hold on local
                klaverns has been weakening. The largest UKA following is in <span class="place ncarolina">North Carolina</span>, where over half of the group's members reside. In <span class="date 1900">July
                    of

                presence of Federal Bureau of Investigation informants was offered as
                the explanation for the unrest, but now it appears that policy differences
                were the reason. On <span class="date 1900">September 15, 1969</span>, a number of <span
                    class="place state">North Carolina</span>
                Klan leaders symbolically burned 125 membership cards on a cross.
                Claiming to represent half the state's membership, the leaders wished to
                break away from the UKA because of the overly centralized control of
                Klan operations. Leadership of the dissident group was to be offered to
                <span class="person jones">Jones</span> upon his release from prison in <span class="date 1900">January,
                    1970</span>, where
                he was serv-
                ing a term in a federal prison for contempt.<sup><a href="#footnote-40">[40]</a></sup> Despite
                this
                bitter
                dissension, the
                literature from the national
                office of the UKA as reflected in
                The Fiery Cross continued to declare, <q>When you're in <span class="place state">North Carolina</span>

                Once again one returns to the question of why people belong to the

                Frequently
                the sentiment is not so clearly directed. One Klan leader in <span class="date 1900">1958</span>
                justifying the activity of the
                Klansmen, a
                justification still used today, declared
                that <q>the Klan isn't anything except anti-devil.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-43">[43]</a></sup>
                Present-day Klan
                literature
                basically has three targets-
                blacks, Jews, and communists. Additional ones such as pacifists and civil rights workers are in
                the
                eyes of
                the Klan merely forms of one of these three evils. The New Left has replaced Roman Catholics and
                immigrants as
                threats to the Invisible Empire, largely because Catholics and newly arrived immigrants are less
                frightening to residents of <span class="place state">Alabama</span>, <span
                    class="place state">Georgia</span>, <span class="place state">Mississippi</span>,
                and
                the <span class="place state">Carolinas</span> than civil rights workers. <br>
                The same controversy over the makeup of the Klan of the <span class="date 1900">1920</span>'s
                surrounds today's Ku Klux Klan.
                Richard Flowers,
                the Attorney General of
                Alabama, said <q>the average kluxer is a fifth-grade school dropout, with a
                    background of social and economic failure.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-44">[44]</a></sup> At
                the
                same
                time a member
                of North Carolinas' State Bureau of Investigation said that respected
                <q>businessmen and professional people are reportedly supporting the
                    Klan, financially and otherwise.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-45">[45]</a></sup> By examining
                present-day
                Klan
                members one sees
                virtually all facets of the
                white Protestant community represented. The study of Duke University sociologist Vander Zanden found
                that two thirds of the Klansmen he studied were <q>on the lower rungs of
                    the middle class- gas station owners, small garage owners, or were on
                    the upper rungs of the working class-auto mechanics, etc.</q><sup><a

                To
                supplement and
                up-date Vander Zanden's data, an
                occupational-age-educational
                analysis was made of all the Klansmen called before the House Un-American Activities Committee
                in
                its <span class="date 1900">1965-1966</span>
                hearings. There is admittedly the tendency for such a sample to be misrepresentative. The
                over-abundance of
                leaders rather than followers is indicated by the fact that 7 percent were full-time Klan
                employees.
                Table I,
                although offering no definite conclusion about the relative
                composition of the contemporary Ku Klux Klan, provides the latest information available on the
                range
                of people
                who belong. The data indicate the average Klansman is a forty-two year old skilled laborer with
                a
                high school
                education.

            One of the important reasons for this type of person belonging to the
            Klan is the feeling of superiority that becoming a citizen of the Invisible
            Empire affords. This is now an even more important reason than earlier
            since many of the other reasons (e.g., the prestige that comes with belonging to the Klan) are
            absent. Vander
                Zanden's principal thesis is that
            Klansmen are men who have been generally thwarted from obtaining
            certain societal goals. Instead of blaming themselves they turn to scape-
            goats and speak of plots, conspiracy, and corruption. One writer says the
            typical Klansmen <q>feels trapped and sees no way out except by lashing
                out viciously at the N***o below him and the white power structure above him.</q><sup><a
                    href="#footnote-47">[47]</a></sup>
            The regalia and emotional symbolism literally lift of the frustrating lives they lead. The
            transformation reaches of absurdity when Klansmen successfully recruit Catholics and grants on the
            pretext that
            they <q>will be accepted as members 'white' community and thus will enjoy all the benefits available
                thereof.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-48">[48]</a></sup><br>
            The methods used by the contemporary Ku Klux Klans are not
            greatly different from those used by the Knights in the <span class="date 1900">1920's</span>.
            Nightriding is
            still employed but is now more
            limited in its scope. A recent example of use of this tactic is the case of a movie theater in <span
                class="place georgia gray">Gray, Georgia</span>,
            which permitted blacks to sit in the balcony. Every Friday night fifty
            carloads of robed Klansmen circled the theater, leading eventually to the
            closing of the movie house.<sup><a href="#footnote-49">[49]</a></sup> Political control is almost
            completely
            absent
            today; although Klansmen still run for office, they rarely get beyond the
            primary. In the one case in <span class="place ncarolina">North Carolina</span> where Klansmen were
            elected
            in <span class="date 1900">1966</span>, they had been unopposed in both the primary and the
            election.
            Their affiliation with the Invisible Empire soon became an issue. The
            hollowness of this "Klan victory" was shown when the two men issued
            statements saying they would not let the Klan influence their jobs as
            sheriff and register of deeds.<sup><a href="#footnote-50">[50]</a></sup> It is only in a few
            scattered
            communities
            and counties that Klansmen can be said to exercise measurable influence
            over civic officials and law enforcement bodies. Lieutenant Governor
            Carroll Gartin<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Gartin" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                    link
                </span></a> of <span class="place mississippi">Mississippi</span>
            put it
            succinctly when he said that <q>a politician could denounce the Klan in
                Mississippi and survive; it isn't that powerful.</q><sup><a href="#footnote-51">[51]</a></sup>
            Such a description certainly
            differs from the Klan of the when politicians routinely joined the Invisible Empire. <br>
            Violence appears still to be intimately related with this secret order.
            Much of the propaganda from contemporary Klan groups indicates a violent posture. In fact the
            rhetoric borders
            on a posture of peaceful existence with the enemy. A circular from the office of the Grand
                Dragon of <span class="place ncarolina">North Carolina</span> reads in part, <q>in the
                event of a riot
                or any
                type of civil strife please stay at home and protect your family and
                property .... Leave it to the local law enforcement officers, your state
                police, and the National Guard to put the trouble down, using lawful
                means.</q> Yet there is no question that as individuals Klansmen tacitly ap-

            often follows
            a Klan rally. The
            Klan has formed which permitted members until recently to purchase ammunition guns at reduced rates.
            Such action
            groups as the Underground, Knock-off Squad, the Holy Terrors, the Wrecking Crew, and Squad are
            experts in
            demolitions and judo. Their determination olent tactics almost becomes an end in itself.<sup><a

            Despite gains as a result of reaction to the <span class="date 1900">1960</span> lunch counter sit
            ins
            and the <span class="date 1900">1961</span> freedom buses, the Klan has never gone over 20,000
            people
            in membership. One must be cautioned against undue optimism never-
            theless. The primary reason for the Klan's limited appeal to the masses
            lies in the formation of White Citizens Councils who focus their attention
            only on the blacks and who to some extent have shunned the extremist
            measures that have characterized the Klan even to the present.<sup><a href="#footnote-55">[55]</a></sup>
            It
            would
            appear then that little encouragement can be taken in the slow death of
            the Ku Klux Klan if it is paralleled by the rise of the White Citizens
            Council.

            <h2>The Transformation of the Klan</h2>
            <p>The Ku Klux Klan throughout its history has retained its outwardly
                patriotic and ritualistic heritage. The Klan hierarchy of wizards, klea-
                gles, and nighthawks has remained the same whether the Invisible Empire has 5,000 or 5,000,000
                members.
                Basically the Klan's strength has
                come from the feeling of uncertainty of certain members of American society when they see their
                life
                styles
                threatened.<br>
                Rather than confronting the change, the Klansmen have, whether in
                <span class="date 1800">1867</span> or <span class="date 1900">1967</span>, resisted the change
                and
                signaled out
                certain groups as the
                agents conspiring to undermine the American way. In the Reconstruction
                Klan the targets were the freed slaves and the North's occupation armies.
                As <span class="event ww1">World War I</span> marked a watershed in the social history of the
                Republic,
                the scapegoat became the Roman Catholics and the Jews. With the ability to adapt in a macabre
                fashion, the
                Knights were quick to seize upon
                pacifists, Indians, Orientals, and a host of others as the perpetrators of
                everything bad. Today all the Klan's evildoers are still around- Jews,
                communists, and pacifists. Klansmen now cringe from the activities of
                civil rights workers, the mass media, and even the local tavern owner
                who allows "colored folk" in on weekday afternoons. This constantly
                changing target of Klan propaganda reflects the changing attitudes of
                American society. As Zald and Asch
                suggest, in order to maintain itself
                as a social movement, the Klan adapted to maintain a large following.
                But no longer can the Klan count five million in its Invisible Empire.
                The Realm's knights barely number enough to raise wooden crosses on
                isolated farms throughout the South and the Midwest. This suggests the second hypothesis, that
                the
                death of a
                social movement does not ily mean that its philosophies, or in this case
                prejudices, are not sent. One does not need to have a sheet over one's head to feel that evil-
                doers are at work everywhere. The white construction workers blocking
                the entry of blacks into trade unions, the White Hats of <span
                    class="place illinois cairo">Cairo,Illinois</span>
                and similar vigilante groups, and the anti-sex education housewives are
                all Klansmen just as if they had ridden out of The Birth of a Nation. As movement the Klan may
                well
                be dead, but
                as a mentality it thrives.<br>
                One of the violent action groups with connections to the Klan is Nacirema or, ironically enough,
                American
                spelled backwards. There are many
                individuals, white and black, who still spell American backwards. Who
                can deny that much of the behavior one sees and reads about today
                epitomizes a klan mentality in all its hatred?
