        <h3>Yale's secret society
        exposed</h3>
        </br>
        <p><span class="date">September 4, 2002</span> — Journalist and author <span class="person Alexandra-Robbins">Alexandra Robbins</span><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Robbins" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> discusses her
        book
        “Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and
        the Hidden Paths of
        Power” with “Today’s” Ann Curry.
        </br>
        The men called their organization the Brotherhood of Death, or, more informally, the
        Order of Skull and Bones. They adopted the numerological symbol 322 because their
        group was the second chapter of the German organization and founded in <span class="date-1800">1832</span>. They
        worshiped the goddess Eulogia, celebrated pirates, and plotted an underground
        conspiracy to dominate the world.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Fast-forward 170 years. Skull and Bones has curled its
        tentacles into every corner of
        American society. This tiny club has set up networks that have thrust three members
        into the most powerful political position in the world. And the group’s influence is
        only increasing-the <span class="date">2004 <span class="event">presidential election</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> might showcase the first time each
        ticket has been led by a Bonesman. The secret society is now, as one historian
        admonishes, ” ‘an international mafia’. . . unregulated and all but unknown.” In its
        quest to create a New World Order that restricts individual freedoms and places
        ultimate power solely in the hands of a small cult of wealthy, prominent families,
        Skull and Bones</span> has already succeeded in infiltrating nearly every major research,
        policy, financial, media, and government institution in the country. Skull and Bones,
        in fact, has been running the <span class="America">United States</span><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"></span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span></a> for years.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Skull and Bones</span> cultivates its talent by selecting members from the junior class at
        Yale, a school known for its strange, Gothic elitism and its rigid devotion
        to the past. The society screens its candidates carefully, favoring Protestants and, now,
        white Catholics, with special affection for the children of wealthy East Coast Skull
        and Bones members. Skull and Bones has been dominated by
        about two dozen of the
        country’s most prominent families—<span class="person Bush">Bush</span><a
                    href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>, <span
            class="person Bundy">Bundy</span></span>, <span class="person Harriman">Harriman</span></span>, <span
            class="person Lord">Lord</span></span>, <span class="person Phelps">Phelps</span></span>,
        <span class="person"><span class="Rockefeller">Rockefeller</span></span>, <span
            class="person Taft">Taft</span></span>, and <span class="person Whitney">Whitney</span><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_family" target="_blak"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> among them—who are encouraged
        by the society to
        intermarry so that its power is consolidated. In fact, Skull and Bones forces members
        to confess their entire sexual histories so that the club, as a eugenics overlord, can
        determine whether a new Bonesman will be fit to mingle with the bloodlines of the
        powerful Skull and Bones dynasties. A rebel will not make Skull and Bones; nor will
        anyone whose background in any way indicates that he will not sacrifice for the
        greater good of the larger organization.</p>
        </br>
        <p>As soon as initiates are allowed into the “tomb,” a dark, windowless crypt in <span class="New-Haven">New
            Haven</span> with a roof that serves as a landing pad for the society’s private helicopter,
        they are sworn to silenceand told they must forever deny that they are members of this
        organization. During initiation, which involves ritualistic psychological conditioning,
        the juniors wrestle in mud and are physically beaten—this stage of the ceremony
        represents their “death” to the world as they have known it. They then lie naked in
        coffins, masturbate, and reveal to the society their innermost sexual secrets. After this
        cleansing, the Bonesmen give the initiates robes to represent their new identities as
        individuals with a higher purpose. The society anoints the initiate with a new name,
        symbolizing his rebirth and rechristening as Knight X, a member of the Order. It is
        during this initiation that the new members are introduced to the artifacts in the tomb,
        among them Nazi memorabilia—including a set of <span class="person Hitler">Hitler's</span><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> silverware-dozens of
        skulls, and an assortment of decorative tchotchkes: coffins, skeletons, and innards.
        They are also introduced to “the Bones whore,” the tomb’s only full-time resident,
        who helps to ensure that the Bonesmen leave the tomb more mature than when they
        entered.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Members of Skull and Bones must make some sacrifices to the society—and they are
        threatened with blackmail so that they remain loyal—but they are remunerated with
        honors and rewards, including a graduation gift of $15,000 and a wedding gift of a tall
        grandfather clock. Though they must tithe their estates to the society, each member
        </br>
        is guaranteed financial security for life; in this way, Bones can ensure that no member
        will feel the need to sell the secrets of the society in order to make a living. And it
        works: No one has publicly breathed a word about his Skull and Bones membership,
        ever.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Bonesmen are automatically offered jobs at the many investment banks and law firms
        dominated by their secret society brothers. They are also given exclusive access to the
        Skull and Bones</span> island, a lush retreat built for millionaires, with a lavish mansion and
        a bevy of women at the members’ disposal.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The influence of the cabal begins at Yale, where Skull and Bones has appropriated
        university funds for its own use, leaving the school virtually impoverished. Skull and
        Bones’ corporate shell, the Russel Trust Association, owns
        nearly all of the
        university’s real estate, as well as most of the land in <span state class="place Connecticut">Connecticut</span><a
        href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>. Skull and Bones
        has controlled Yale faculty and campus
        publications so that students cannot speak
        openly about it. “Year by year,” the campus’s only anti-society publication stated
        during its brief tenure in 1873, “the deadly evil is growing.”</p>
        </br>
        <p>The year in the tomb at Yale instills within
        members an unwavering loyalty to Skull
        and Bones. Members have been known to stab their Skull and Bones pins into their
        skin to keep them in place during swimming or bathing. The knights (as the student
        members are called) learn quickly that their allegiance to the society must supersede
        all else: family, friendships, country, God. They are taught that once they get out into
        the world, they are expected to reach positions of prominence so that they can further
        elevate the society’s status and help promote the standing of their fellow Bonesmen.</p>
        </br>
        <p>This purpose has driven Bonesmen to ascend to the top levels of so many fields that,
        as one historian observes, “at any one time The Order can call on members in any
        area of American society to do what has to be done.” Several Bonesmen have been
        <span class="role">senators</span>, <span class="role">congressmen</span>, <span class="role">Supreme Court
            justices</span>, and <span class="role">Cabinet officials</span>. There is a
        Bones cell in the CIA, which uses the society as a recruiting ground because the
        members are so obviously adept at keeping secrets. Society members dominate
        financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Brown brothers Harriman, where at one time more than a third of the partners were
        Bonesmen. Through these companies, Skull and Bones provided financial
        backing to
        <span class="person Hitler">Adolf Hitler</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>
        because the society then followed a Nazi-and now follows a neo-Nazi—
        doctrine. At least a dozen Bonesmen have been linked to the Federal Reserve,
        including the first chairman of the <span class="place state New-York">New York</span><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span> </a> Federal Reserve. Skull and Bones
        members control the wealth of the <span class="person Rockefeller">Rockefeller</span>, <span
            class="person Carnegie">Carnegie</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>, and <span
            class="person Ford">Ford</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> families.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Skull and Bones</span> has also taken steps to control the American media.
    
        Two of its members founded the law firm that represents the New York Times . Plans
        for both Time and Newsweek magazines were
        hatched in the Skull and Bones tomb.
        The society has controlled publishing houses such as Farrar, Straus & Giroux. In the
        <span class="date">1880s</span>, Skull and Bones
        created the American Historical Association, the
            American
            Psychological Association, and the American Economic Association so
        that the
        society could ensure that history would be written under its terms and promote its
        objectives. The society then installed its own members as the presidents of these
        associations.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Under the society’s direction, Bonesmen developed and dropped the nuclear bomb
        and choreographed the <span class="event">Bay of Pigs</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>. Skull and Bones members had ties to
        <span class="event">Watergate</span> and the <span class="event">Kennedy Assasination</span><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassinio_di_John_Fitzgerald_Kennedy" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>.
        They control the Council on Foreign
            Relations and the Trilateral Commission so that they can push their own
        political
        agenda. Skull and Bones</span> government officials have used the number 322 as codes for
        highly classified diplomatic assignments. The society discriminates against minorities
        and fought for slavery; indeed eight out of twelve of Yale's residential
        colleges are
        named for slave owners while none are named for abolitionists. The society
        encourages misogyny: it did not admit women until the <span class="date-1900">1990s</span> because members did
        not believe women were capable of handling the Skull and Bones experience and
        because they said they feared incidents of date rape. This society also encourages
        grave robbing: deep within the bowels of the tomb are the stolen skulls of the Apache
        chief <span class="person Geronimo">Geronimo</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geronimo" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>,
        <span class="person Pancho-Villa">Pancho Villa</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>, and former <span class="role">president <span class="person Martin-Van-Buren">Martin Van Buren</span><a
                    href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a></span>.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Finally, the society has taken measures to ensure that the secrets of Skull and Bones
        slip ungraspable like sand through open fingers. <span class="role">Journalist <span
                class=" person Ron-Rosenbaum">Ron Rosenbaum</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rosenbaum" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a></span>, who
        wrote a long but not probing article about the society in the <span class="date-1900">1970s</span>, claimed that a
        source warned him not to get too close.
        </br>
        “What bank do you have your checking account at?” this party asked me in the
        middle of a discussion of the Mithraic aspects of the Bones ritual.
    
        I named the bank. “Aha,” said the party. “There are three Bonesmen on the board.
        You’ll never have a line of credit again.
    
        They’ll tap your phone. They’ll. . . ” . . .The source continued: “The alumni still care.
        Don’t laugh. They don’t like people tampering and prying. The power of Bones is
        incredible. They’ve got their hands on every lever of power in the country. You’ll
        see—it’s like trying to look into the Mafia.”</p>
        </br>
        <p>In the <span class="date-1900">1980s</span>, a man known only as Steve had contracts to write two books on the
        society, using documents and photographs he had acquired from the Bones crypt. But
        Skull and Bones</span> found out about Steve. Society members broke into his apartment,
        stole the documents, harassed the would-be author, and scared him into hiding, where
        he has remained ever since. The books were never completed. In Universal Pictures’
        thriller The Skulls (2000), an aspiring journalist is writing a profile of the society for
        the New York Times. When he sneaks into the
        tomb, the Skulls murder him.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The real Skull and Bones tomb displays a bloody knife in a glass case. It is said that
        when a Bonesman stole documents and threatened to publish society secrets if the
        members did not pay him a determined amount of money, they used that knife to kill
        him.</p>
        </br>
        <p>This, then, is the legend of Skull and Bones. It is astonishing
        that so many people
        continue to believe, even in twenty-first-century <span class="place state America">America</span><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"></span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span></a>that a tiny college club
        wields such an enormous amount of influence on the world’s only superpower. The
        breadth of clout ascribed to this organization is practically as wide-ranging as the
        leverage of the satirical secret society the Stonecutters introduced in an episode of
        The Simpsons. The Stonecutters theme song included the lyrics:
        </br>
        Who controls the British crown?
        Who keeps the metric system down? We do! We do. . .
    
        Who holds back the electric car?
        Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star? We do! We do.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Certainly, Skull and Bones does cross boundaries in order to attempt to stay out of the
        public spotlight. When I wrote an article about the society for the Atlantic Monthly in
        <span class="date">May 2000</span>, an older Bonesman said to me, “If it’s not portrayed positively, I’m
        sending a couple of my friends after you.” After the article was published, I received a
        telephone call at my office from a fellow journalist, who is a member of Skull and
        Bones.</p>
        </br>
        <p>He scolded me for writing the article—”writing that article was not an ethical or
        honorable way to make a decent living in journalism,” he condescended —and then
        asked me how much I had been paid for the story.
    
        When I refused to answer, he hung up. Fifteen minutes later, he called back.
    
        “I have just gotten off the phone with our people.” “Your people?” I snickered.
    
        “Yes. Our people.” He told me that the society demanded to know where I got my
        information.
    
        “I’ve never been in the tomb and I did nothing illegal in the process of reporting this
        article,” I replied.
    
        “Then you must have gotten something from one of us. Tell me whom you spoke to.
        We just want to talk to them,” he wheedled. “I don’t reveal my sources.”
        </br>
        Then he got angry. He screamed at me for a while about how dishonorable I was for
        writing the article. “A lot of people are very despondent over this!” he yelled. “Fifteen
        Yale juniors are very,
        very upset!” I thanked him for telling me his concerns.
    
        “There are a lot of us at newspapers and at political journalism institutions,” he coldly
        hissed. “Good luck with your career”—and he slammed down the phone.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Skull and Bones</span>, particularly in recent years, has managed to pervade both popular
        and political culture. In the <span class="date-1900">1992</span> race for the Republican presidential nomination,
        <span class="person Pat-Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Buchanan" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> accused <span class="role">President <span class="person George-Bush">George W.</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span></a></span> of running “a
        Skull and Bones</span> presidency.”</p>
        </br>
        <p>In <span class="date-1900">1993</span>, during <span class="person Jeb-Bush">Jeb Bush</span><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeb_Bush" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> <span class="place state Florida">Florida</span><a
                href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a> <span class="role">gubernatorial
            campaign</span>, one of his constituents
        asked him, “You’re familiar with the Skull and Crossbones Society?” When <span class="George-Bush">George W.</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span></a>
        responded, “Yeah, I’ve heard about it,” the constituent persisted, “Well, can you tell
        the people here what your family membership in that is? Isn’t your aim to take control
        of the United States?” In <span class="date">January 2001</span>, New York Times <span class="role">columnist</span> <span
            class="cited-authors Maureen-Dowd">Maureen Dowd</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/maureen-dowd" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>	used Skull and Bones</span> in a simile: “When <span class="person">W.</span> met the press with his choice for
        attorney general, <span class="person John-Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ashcroft" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span></a>, before Christmas, he vividly showed how important
        it is to him that his White House be as leak-proof as the <span class="Skull-and-Bones">Skull & Bones</span>
        ‘tomb.’”</p>
        </br>
        <p>That was less than a year after the Universal Pictures film introduced the secret
        society to a new demographic perhaps uninitiated into the doctrines of modern-day
        conspiracy theory. Not long before the movie was previewed in theaters—and perhaps
        in anticipation of the <span class="event">election of</span><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">link</span> </a><span
                class="person George-Bush">George W.</span><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined"></span></a> letter was distributed to
        members from Skull and Bones
        headquarters. “In view of the political happenings in
        the barbarian world,” the memo read, “I feel compelled to remind all of the tradition
        of privacy and confidentiality essential to the well-being of our Order and strongly
        urge stout resistance to the seductions and blandishments of the Fourth Estate.” This
        vow of silence remains the society’s most important rule. Bonesmen have been
        exceedingly careful not to break this code of secrecy, and have kept specific details
        about the organization out of the press. Indeed, given the unusual, strict written
        reminder to stay silent, members of Skull and Bones may well
        refuse to speak to any
        member of the media ever again.</p>
        </br>
        <p>But they have already spoken to me. When? Over the past three years. Why? Perhaps
        because I am a member of one of Skull and Bones kindred Yale secret societies.
        Perhaps because some of them are tired of the Skull and Bones legend, of the claims
        of conspiracy theorists and some of their fellow Bonesmen. What follows, then, is the
        truth about Skull and Bones. And if this truth does not contain all of the conspiratorial
        elements that the Skull and Bones legend projects, it
        is perhaps all the more
        interesting for that fact. The story of Skull and Bones is not just the story
        of a
        remarkable secret society, but a remarkable society of secrets, some with basis in
        truth, some nothing but fog. Much of the way we understand the world of power
        involves myriad assumptions of connection and control, of cause and effect, and of
        coincidence that surely cannot be coincidence.</p>
