                        the
                        defense
                        of
                        Americanism, a
                        frequent theme in his writing. Among the central tenets of <span
                            class="person evans">Evans</span>’s
                        Americanism was a
                        devotion
                        to Protestantism. It was in the religious fulfillment of Protestantism, <span
                            class="person evans">Evans</span> would
                        suggest that
                        American values could be fully recognized, predominantly the American concern with
                        individualism. In this essay, I argue that <span class="person evans">Evans</span>
                        ambiguously
                        defined
                        his notion of
                        Americanism
                        by making substantial efforts to associate his organization's goals with the American civil
                        religious tradition. <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s strategically ambiguous
                        rhetoric
                        portrayed a unified,
                        moral and
                        political vision for American life that served the Klan throughout the <span
                            class="date 1900">1920s</span>, but
                        ultimately
                        undermined the virtues that the civil religious tradition was initially intended to
                        maintain.

            <p>While mention of the Ku Klux Klan conjures images of right-wing political
                extremism, the Klan of the <span class="date 1900">1920s</span> was a social, political, and
                cultural
                force with
                which to be
                reckoned. The organization defied any simple extremist classification <a href="#bib-0">(MacLean,
                    1994,

                Historian <span class="author moore">Leonard J. Moore</span> argued that the Klan of the <span
                    class="date 1900">1920s</span> differed considerably
                from the
                Klan of the post-civil war era and the Klan that opposed the mid-century civil rights movement.
                The Klan, Moore claimed, “represented mainstream social and political concerns, not those of a
                disaffected fringe group” <a href="#bib-1">(1990, p. 342)</a>.<br>
                These concerns were often expressed in a vernacular that many Americans would not
                recognize as radical. Noted historian <span class="author hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</span>, for
                instance, once

                abilities to effectively project these concerns played a significant role in his leadership of the

                <span class="person evans">Evans</span> rhetorical use of Americanism may be best described as
                strategically
                ambiguous,
                insofar as it appealed not only to the Klan faithful, but also sought to speak to those who might
                have a similar vision of that Americanism, without consideration of the ends to which such
                values served as means. As communication scholar <span class="author eisenberg">Eric
                    Eisenberg</span>
                noted,
                <q>strategically
                    ambiguous communication allows the source to both reveal and conceal,</q> <a href="#bib-5">(1984, p.

                powers
                that <span class="person evans">Evans</span> clearly coveted in his drive to expand the social and
                political power of
                his
                organization. For <span class="person evans">Evans</span>, establishing the notion that the Klan was
                somehow
                organically
                connected to the widespread embrace of Americanism might further integrate that organization
                into the political mainstream at a point in its history in which its notoriety still trailed its
                influence.<br>
                Noting the historical fact of the Klan's level of success in the <span class="date 1900">1920s</span>,
                the rhetoric
                that
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span> used to define Americanism and the means by which the Klan
                could
                achieve it
                are worthy
                of our attention. In this essay, I argue that <span class="person evans">Evans</span> defined his
                notion
                of
                Americanism by making
                substantial efforts to associate the Klan's goals with the American civil religious tradition. Next,
                I argue that <span class="person evans">Evans</span> used a rhetoric couched in the terms of civil
                religious discourse
                to cloak the
                Klan's moral interpretation of Americanism in vagueness. Furthermore, I argue that <span
                    class="person evans">Evans</span> uses
                civil religious discourse to identify to establish “alienism” as the primary threat to Americanism
                and thus the American civil religion. In adhering to those tactics, I claim that <span
                    class="person evans">Evans</span>'s rhetoric
                portrayed a unified, moral and political vision for American life that served the Klan throughout
                the <span class="date 1900">1920s</span>, but ultimately undermined the virtues that the civil
                religious
                tradition
                was initially
                intended to maintain. Before undertaking such an endeavor, I will provide a more complete
                examination of civil religion, particularly in relation to political discourse.

            <h2>The Contextual Frame: American Civil Religion</h2>
            <p><span class="author bellah">Bellah</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bellah" target="_blank"><span
                        class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a> first addressed the issue of civil religion in an essay
                published in <span class="date 1900">1967</span>. As
                <span class="author bellah">Bellah</span> explained, the concept of civil religion was initially
                derived
                from the
                Rousseau's <cite>Social
                    Contract</cite> <a href="#bib-6">(1967, p.5)</a>. He then argued that a variant of Rousseau's
                conception
                held
                sway with
                the
                founding fathers, manifesting itself in <q>a theme that lies very deep in the American tradition,
                    namely the obligation, both collective and individual, to carry out God's will on earth</q> <a
                    href="#bib-6">(1967,
                    p.5)</a>.<br>
                Civil religion, <span class="author bellah">Bellah</span> argued, played a unifying role in American
                political life.
                After
                devoting some thought onto the issue of civil religion in light of the political turmoil of the late
                <span class="date 1900">60s</span> and <span class="date 1900">early 70s</span>, <span
                    class="author bellah">Bellah</span> argued that civil religion had become
                <q>an
                    empty and broken
                    shell</q><a href="#bib-7">(1992, p. 142)</a>. The failure to address any conception of a common good
                will
                lead
                American society to its doom, he suggested <a href="#bib-7">(1992, p. xiv)</a>.<br>
                While <span class="author bellah">Bellah</span> offered a renewed commitment to civil religion as a
                unifying vehicle
                for the
                American public <a href="#bib-7">(1992, p. 176)</a>, this should not to suggest that the concept is
                without its
                difficulties. The genocide of Native American populations and the existence of slavery, he
                claimed, occurred in spite of moral conceptions afforded by civil religion <a href="#bib-7">(1992,
                    p.
                    37)</a>.
                However, from <span class="author bellah">Bellah</span>'s perspective, the use of civil religious
                rhetoric for morally
                questionable
                ends is not the product of civil religion itself, but rather the failure to embrace an authentic
                civil
                religious discourse. <br>
                While <span class="author bellah">Bellah</span> might label such instances as failures to embrace
                civil
                religious
                virtues,
                others have claimed that these instances might be better perceived as failures of civil religious
                rhetoric to cope with issues of heterogeneous populations (<a href="#bib-8">Albanese, 1982, p.
                    23</a>;
                <a href="#bib-21">Fenn, 1977, p.
                    514</a>). In order to address this shortcoming, civil religious discourses make use of
                ambiguity. As
                <span class="author bennett">W. Lance Bennett</span><a

                    </span></a> explains, the use of ambiguity <q>ensures that the "multiple realities" of a
                    heterogeneous public can be accommodated within the sacred symbols of the state” <a
                        href="#bib-9">(1979,

                    For <span class="person evans">Hiram Wesley Evans</span>, Protestantism and the concept that he
                    labeled
                    "Americanism"
                    were intertwined as the ultimate manifestation of the American civil religion. As he noted in
                    <span class="date 1900">1930</span>:
                    Protestantism-religious, civil, or economic, and often all three-protest against human
                    authority over the souls, the bodies, the rights and the yearnings of man-this was the spirit which
                    animated, almost without exception, the men who made America. (<a href="#bib-19">The Rising Storm
                        166</a>).<br>
                    Before undergoing a more thorough examination of <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s
                    conception of
                    "Americanism", I briefly review the historical context of <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s

                contributed to
                that growth.
                <span class="author bennett">Bennett</span> argued that the Klan was <q>a reaction to the displacement

                This

                was the result of rapid urbanization, which in turn resulted in a variety of repressive phenomena,
                among which the Klan was one of many.<br>

                has
                suggested
                that the appeal of the Klan
                lay

                conception of
                civil religion
                will yield valuable insights into both the Klan's history and into a broader historical
                understanding of American civil religion.
            </p>
            <h2>American Civil Religion and the Articulation of "Americanism"</h2>
            <p>According to <span class="person evans">Evans</span>, the Klan spoke for those struggling with the
                moral
                decay and
                economic distress of the 20th century. His rhetoric explicitly identified those whom <span
                    class="person evans">Evans</span>
                sought to unify. While our common understanding of the Klan suggests that the prejudices of
                that organization were apparent, <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s discourse hints that such
                prejudice was
                rarely, if ever,
                explicitly articulated. <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s rhetoric used three primary
                strategies
                to articulate
                Americanism.
                The first firmly associated his organization with the nation's civil religious tradition.<br>
                The second used an intentional ambiguity that posited Americanism as an intangible
                force that could not be concretely identified, but still existed and exerted tangible influence. The
                strategic use of ambiguity also facilitated an ability to adopt all those qualities that he
                determined
                to be signifiers of Americanism back to the earlier civil religious traditions that defined the
                Klan.<br>
                The third strategy consisted of an extreme anti-alien sentiment that posited alienism as
                the threat to the continuation of the aforementioned civil religious experience. By defining the
                American civil religion as one bounded by Protestant considerations, with vaguely defined
                notions of Americanism and parameters which excluded all those groups who sought refuge and
                shelter in the United States, the Klan portrayed a unified, all encompassing vision for American
                political life that served them well throughout the <span class="date 1900">1920s</span> <a
                    href="#bib-18">(Bennett,
                    1979, p. 106)</a>. With the
                Klan's illiberal orientation in mind, <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s appeared to be
                reconciling the Klan's
                efforts within
                the most palatable framework available to his audience.</p>
            <h2>The Klan and America’s Civil Religious History</h2>
            <p>First, <span class="person evans">Evans</span> embraced explicit references to the interconnection of
                the
                Klan and
                American civil religion. For example, after citing <span class="person washington">George
                    Washington</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington" target="_blank"><span
                        class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>, <span class="person evans">Evans</span> stated:
                From this quotation it is perfectly clear that the founders of the nation did not desire to
                separate the State from Christian morality, based upon religion. They saw clearly that a free
                government must itself take over many of these moral functions which an autocratic government
                leaves in the hands of the State Church <a href="#bib-19">(1930, p. 23)</a>.<br>
                In <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s work, the separation of Church and State is the
                ultimate
                protection
                against
                unwarranted sectarian influence from the Catholic Church and that separation is distinct from the
                maintenance of traditional Protestant virtue. <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s rhetoric
                mirrors
                <span class="author bellah">Bellah</span>'s
                conception of
                civil religious rhetoric is distinctly non-sectarian <a href="#bib-20">(Bellah, 1967, p. 8)</a>, as
                his
                embrace
                of
                Protestantism is largely the product of a rejection of Catholic sectarianism.<br>
                In that the Klan's greatest opposition often came from American Catholics, and given the
                growing significance of the Catholic population in the United States <a href="#bib-01">(Knoble
                    198)</a>,
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span> wisely
                avoided attacking Catholics as individuals, opting instead to attack Catholicism as an institution.
                Fear of the Catholic Church's authority was a persistent theme throughout <span
                    class="person evans">Evans</span>
                work. As he
                noted:
                They are used to seeing the government submit to the moral dictation of a church, but
                cannot understand why, when it refuses such dictation, it should submit to the individual
                consciences of its citizens <a href="#bib-19">(1930, p. 181)</a>.<br>
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span> suggested that the Klan was not anti-Catholic, but instead
                anti-Catholic
                Church.
                He also took pains to identify those Catholics who disagreed with the Church. The individuals
                might find league with the Klan, he claimed, as the Church has already dismissed them as <q>bad</q>
                Catholics <a href="#bib-17">("The Klan's Fight for Americanism" 48)</a>. This created a more unified
                perception
                among lapsed Catholics and their Protestant brethren in the Klan. Surely a "religion" which
                undermined the institutions that the civil religion sought to maintain was to be excluded from the
                larger civil religious dialogue.<br>
                A great deal of criticism was oriented around the Church's involvement in politics, which
                again, was relevant in light of the degree to which it undermined the non-sectarian presumption
                of civil religion. The Catholic Church, he claimed, threatened to erode the wall between church
                and state that maintained freedom <a href="#bib-22">(1926, p. 47)</a>. To prove his point, he cited
                instances of
                Catholic participation in urban politics and then explained that Catholics often found themselves
                in political coalitions with Jews and other "aliens".<br>
                While he suggested that participation alone did not demonstrate the sanction of the
                church in politics, he did cite his experiences at the Democratic national convention of <span
                    class="date 1900">1924</span> to
                claim that the massive presence of Catholic priests there seemed to prove that the Church was
                indeed directly involved in the affairs of State.<br>
                There was some tension in <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s critique of the Church and his
                profession of
                Protestant
                faith. While he criticized the Catholic Church for the very nature of its centralized belief system,
                he also recognized the religious obligations of Klansmen as emanating from biblical tradition.
                As he stated:
                The order goes to the great scholar and leader in the early Church, the Apostle Paul, the
                Evangel to the Gentile, to find its creed and code of conduct. In his Epistle to the Romans, he
                carries the ideal of Klannishness to its highest levels, and in the twelfth chapter of that great
                exposition which he makes of the teachings of Christ, he sets up a standard of character and of
                conduct by which every true Klansmen must measure his life. <a href="#bib-23">(Date unknown B, p.
                    7-8)</a>.<br>
                It was in common and shared religious tradition, <span class="person evans">Evans</span> proclaimed,
                that the Klansman
                found his ultimate purpose. That tradition resulted in a uniformity of theology and epistemology
                that ultimately challenged the veracity of the Klan's claim that their primary issue with
                Catholicism was political rather than theological. Distinguishing civil religious experience from
                a Catholic religious experience that might bridge the wall between church and state, established
                the Klan's parameters for religious propriety. Protestantism, it is suggested, was excusable in the
                exercise of democracy, as it did not constitute a distinct sectarian affiliation.
            </p>
            <h2>Ambiguous Americanism and Civil Religion</h2>
            <p><span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s second strategy involved the explicit definition of
                Americanism. By
                articulating
                Americanism as an intangible quality, he established a unique prophetic vision for "old stock
                Americans", as only legitimate Americans like <span class="person evans">Evans</span> can identify
                the
                components of
                Americanism. In the following passage, <span class="person evans">Evans</span> explicitly identified
                Americanism as an
                inherent
                quality that did not require explicit definition:
                It is merely playing with words and fogging the situation to claim, as some do, that the
                Americans themselves do not know what Americanism is, or to say as <span class="author bok">Edward
                    Bok</span> said, <q>The
                    first need is to Americanize the Americans</q>. <a href="#bib-24">(1930, p. 8-9)</a><br>
                To hazard a guess as to what Americanism was rendered an individual suspect.
                Americanism was so innate as to defy the need for definition. This was specifically in concert
                with the ambiguity function of previous civil religious discourse. In order to address diverse
                audiences, civil religious rhetoric necessitates ambiguity <a href="#bib-25">(Bennett, 1979, p.
                    116)</a>.
                Ambiguity
                creates participatory space in <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s rhetoric, allowing all who
                witness it to feel
                a part of the
                Klan's struggle. While the range of that audience is still limited to white Anglo Protestants, the
                heterogeneity of interests among that group are reconciled by the strategic employment of
                ambiguous Americanism. <br>
                This also demonstrates the major ethical shortcoming of civil religion. In being
                appropriated towards illiberal ends, and given the fiction of a potentially unified audience, civil
                religion need only be addressed as an appeal to a limited audience, with the further effect of
                trivializing any heterogeneous difference that does exist within that audience. Civil religious
                discourse works best in creating the perception that any difference beyond race and personal
                faith are irrelevant to larger questions of unity. <br>
                Perhaps the most explicit definition of Americanism was ultimately an effort to tie the
                abstract conception of Americanism to the earlier efforts to place the Klan within the civil
                religious perspective. In <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s words
                Our cause is true Americanism. This means in all vital things a superior Christian
                civilization for America. Our destiny is the common welfare, materially and mentally,
                physically and spiritually, upon a plane high above any mankind has ever known. <a href="#bib-26">(1923,
                    p.
                    3)</a>.<br>
                Americanism, then, was that terminal value achieved when Americans adhered to
                established civil religious perspectives.<br>
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s sense of history and the civil religious perspective was
                to
                some degree
                limited to
                serve his own ends. When necessary, he vaguely alluded to the history of the Klan without
                explicitly delineating his points of departure from those philosophies. While such vagueness
                might have been intended to retain the loyalties of his predecessors, it also served to further
                illustrate the benefit of vagueness. As <span class="person evans">Evans</span> noted, <q>beneath the
                    stupid or
                    dangerous oratory of
                    the early leaders lay certain fundamental truths…which matured automatically</q><a
                    href="#bib-17">(1926,
                    p.
                    36)</a>.
                He then said <q>it laid the basis for the astounding growth of the last three years, and for the
                    present immense influence</q><a href="#bib-17">(1926, p. 36)</a>. The above referenced passage
                allowed
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span> to
                criticize the past regime of power, while he also cast himself as a rational agent in comparison to
                that regime.
            </p>
            <h2>Anti-Alienism and Civil Religion</h2>
            <p>Finally, while intentional vagueness mars a more complete understanding of
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s Americanism, attention to his anti-alien discourse
                illuminates
                that concept
                more clearly.
                It is the immigrant, <span class="person evans">Evans</span> warned, that truly threatened Americanism
                <a href="#bib-28">(Date Unknown A, p. 3)</a>.
                The immigrant problem, it appeared, was largely related to the undesirability of the alien masses.
                The alien violated the tenets of the American covenant for their own benefit. For example,
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span> portrayed the immigrant as an unmitigated capitalist,
                <q>Ignorant
                    and unskilled,
                    covetous
                    and greedy, they come to this country. . . with the one sole and ultimate end in view-the
                    accumulation of American money where with to retire in later years to their beloved homelands</q>
                <a href="#bib-28">(Date Unknown A, p. 5)</a>. Aliens continued to pose a threat as they clearly
                lacked
                the
                qualities
                that were exceptional in Americans, as they consisted of <q>ignorant, superstitious, religious
                    devotees</q> <a href="#bib-28">(Date Unknown A, p. 8)</a>.<br>
                In other instances, <span class="person evans">Evans</span> made careful efforts to defend
                Americanism
                from being
                tainted
                by alienism. The struggle was ultimately the Nordic people against the alien hordes, who had
                rendered the Nordic man a stranger in his own home: <q>Shortly they came to dominate us</q> <a
                    href="#bib-29">(1926,
                    p. 39)</a> he began. "So the Nordic American", <span class="person evans">Evans</span>
                continued,
                <q>today is a
                    stranger . . . A most
                    unwelcome stranger</q><a href="#bib-29">(1926,
                    p. 39)</a>.<br>
                The domestic American experience in <span class="event ww1">WWI</span> greatly informed <span
                    class="person evans">Evans</span>'s arguments against
                alienism. The war, he argued, unveiled for all Americans the menace lying just beneath the
                surface of American life of alienism. Liberalism's folly, according to <span
                    class="personevans">Evans</span>, was
                its association
                with foreign ideals. As he claimed: <q>The plain people now see that Liberalism has come
                    completely under the dominance of weaklings and parasites whose alien "idealism" reaches its
                    logical peak in the Bolshevist platform of "produce as little as you can, beg or steal from those
                    who do not produce and kill the producer for thinking he is better than you</q><a
                    href="#bib-29">(1926,
                    p. 42)</a>. He
                associated Liberalism with both Bolshevism and nihilism, hounding it as a conspiratorial
                philosophy in much the same way that prior democratic ideals were dismissed as parts of the
                Jacobin conspiracy in 18th century France and America <a href="#bib-30">(Hofman, 1993)</a>.<br>
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s anti-alien discourse defined not so much Americanism as it
                did
                the
                parameters
                for those things that were distinctly non-American. It established sectarian limits on the
                American civil religion, confining that religion to one that advanced Americanism while it
                avoided all traits projected unto non-Americans.
            </p>
            <h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
            <p>By defining the American civil religion as one bounded by Protestant considerations,
                with vaguely defined notions of Americanism and parameters which excluded all those groups
                who sought refuge and shelter in the United States, the Klan portrayed a unified, all
                encompassing vision for American political life that served them well throughout the <span
                    class="date 1900">1920s</span>.
                <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s rhetoric used three primary strategies to articulate his
                organization's
                place within the
                American civil religious tradition. The first associated his organization with the nation's civil
                religious tradition, isolating Catholicism as a legitimate constraint on the full non-sectarian
                exercise of religious freedom. The second used an intentional ambiguity that posited
                Americanism as an intangible force that could not be concretely identified, but still existed and
                exerted tangible influence. The third strategy posited alienism as the threat to the continuation of
                the aforementioned civil religious experience. Americanism and civil religion were thus most
                closely defined by negation.<br>
                In spite of apparent successes, the Klan began to experience some declines by <span
                    class="date 1900">1925</span>.
                Violence against the Klan became commonplace as the Klan had expanded in the <span

                    p. 224-225, 235-236)</a>. Regardless of the particulars of the Klan's dissolution, that
                organization's
                entry into the political mainstream deserves our attention. While <span

                its prior virtue, this essay seems to suggest that such comments should be approached with
                caution. <span class="person evans">Evans</span>'s rhetoric seems to illustrate that the inability
                to
                truly address a
                genuinely
                heterogeneous public renders civil religion more ideally suited toward illiberal ends.
