Yet the hall was not only the climax of <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> preoccupation with the poetry of domed top-lit spaces; as a building hemmed in on all sides by others, it was characteristic of the circumstances which produced many of his finest works. Nor has the relation of the Masonic Hall to <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> great kitchen beneath been noticed, though each interior had an unusual ceiling, totally different from the other, yet designed as part of a hierarchy ascending from the functionalism of the kitchen to the poetry of the Masonic chamber which surmounted it both physically and spiritually. No less important is the fact that this commission raises the whole question of <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> activities as a Freemason and the meaning which Freemasonry may have held for him.</p><p> It is surely reasonable to assume that <span class="person soane">Soane</span>, initiated as a Freemason in <span class="date 1800">1813</span>, took Freemasonry very seriously. He carried out numerous architectural and decorative improvements at the London headquarters of the Freemasons in <span class="place">Great Queen Street</span>, contributed £500 to the cost of his Masonic Hall, and gave extensively to Masonic charities, in accordance with the fraternal ideals of the brotherhood. He took part in Masonic ceremonies and even went so far as to commission a portrait of himself in Masonic dress [Figure 2]. In this portrait, he is shown sitting in his Masonic Hall beside the remarkable Ark of the Masonic Covenant, which he had designed in <span class="date 1800">1813</span>.<sup>2</sup> He even chose to vault the dressing room leading out of his study at <span class="place">Sir John Soane's Museum</span> with a miniature version of his canopy and lantern at the Masonic Hall.</p><p> No less significantly, <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> extensive course of reading in the theory of the French Enlightenment made him aware that Freemasonry could be regarded as the religion of the Enlightenment.

Opened at a solemn ceremony in <span class="date 1700">1776</span>, the <span class="place">Masonic Hall</span> resembled the interior of a great Roman Doric temple.<sup>20</sup> <span class="person sandby">Sandby</span>, who had promoted a kind of speaking or symbolic architecture in his Royal Academy lectures, adorned the metopes in the frieze with Masonic emblems such as triangles, intersecting circles, suns, and stars.<sup>21</sup> In the center of the ceiling, a representation of the sun in burnished gold was surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac.<sup>22</sup></p>

                <h3>SOANE AS A FREEMASON</h3>
                <p>On <span class="date 1800">11 December 1813</span>, <span class="person soane">Soane</span> met the <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> at the <span class="place">Freemasons' Tavern</span>, taking with him three drawings, possibly for the new ark. <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> surviving designs for the ark include one, date eightd <span class="date 1800">December 1813</span>, which is triangular in form with a column at each corner.<sup>23</sup> It was a version of this design that was executed.<sup>24</sup> Although destroyed in the great fire of <span class="date 1800">1883</span>, it can be seen in the painting by <span class="person rosenthal">Sigismund Rosenthal</span>, "The Reception of the Prince of Wales as a Past Grand Master" in <span class="date 1800">December 1869</span>.<sup>24</sup> Due to the ceremony in which this unusual object was to feature taking place in a little over two weeks, <span class="person soane">Soane</span> was given very little time for design and execution. According to the office day book kept by his chief assistant, <span class="person bailey">George Bailey</span>, the ark was designed between <span class="date 1800">14 and 20 December</span>, with long hours of work. The drawings were completed in parts and given to <span class="person martyr">Thomas Martyr</span>, <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> favorite joiner and cabinetmaker.<sup>26</sup></p>
                
                <p><span class="person soane">Soane's</span> ark bore no resemblance to the conventional Biblical ark, which was a modest, portable object. The image of the conventional ark was featured in the arms of both the <span class="congragation">United Grand Lodge of England</span> and the <span class="congragation">Antient Grand Lodge</span>. It was based on the directions given to Moses for an ark made of shittim wood (acacia) and flanked by two cherubim.<sup>27</sup> In contrast, <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> mahogany ark was entirely different.</p>
                
                <p>Measuring four feet three inches high and three feet four inches wide, it was triangular in shape with a column at each corner representing the Doric, Ionic, and <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()"> Corinthian orders symbolizing wisdom, strength, and beauty respectively,</span> each with its appropriate entablature. With its tall central door, it resembled a large cupboard, pedestal, or, characteristically for <span class="person soane">Soane</span>, a tomb. It also shared formal similarities with the triangular Simeon Monument, which <span class="person soane">Soane</span> built in the <span class="place">Market Place in Reading</span> in <span class="date 1800">1804</span>, an obelisk and lamp post adorned with symbolic ornamentation.<sup>28</sup> Furthermore, <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> ark is reminiscent of the curious pedestals—triangular with domed finials—that are featured in his Pitt Cenotaph at the National Debt Redemption Office of <span class="date 1800">1818</span>.<sup>29</sup> These enigmatic commemorative pedestals contribute to the somber solemnity of the cenotaph in a manner that is distinctly characteristic of their architect.</p>

The two Grand Masters placed the said act of Union in the Interior of the said ark.

                <p>The <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> then installed <span class="person soane">Soane</span> as Grand Superintendent of Works, a post he held until his death in <span class="date 1800">1837</span>. The significance of the post went beyond the design of an ark or the rearrangement shown in the other drawings prepared at the time, for at the same meeting on <span class="date 1800">27 December</span> a Board of Works had been established, with Soane as a member. This had the two following objectives: "the proper accommodation of the <span class="congregation">Grand Lodge</span> and its several Boards and Committees at their respective meetings" and "the correct and appropriate decorations and Furniture of the grand Lodge and the Masonic Jewels, Emblems and Clothing of the Grand Officers and other Brethren." These implied a new building and a decorative program centered on appropriate ornament, just the topic with which Soane was so preoccupied at this time, when he was preparing his Royal Academy lectures. In <span class="date 1800">1813</span> he had delivered his first course of six lectures, and was to deliver the second course for the first time in <span class="date 1800">1815</span>, in which year he was also appointed President of the Board of Works at the United Grand Lodge . In <span class="date 1800">1814</span> he surveyed the houses adjacent to the Freemasons' Tavern on the east, at <span class="place">62 and 63 Great Queen Street</span>, with a view to their purchase so as to enable new premises to be built. They were purchased in <span class="date 1800">1815</span> and on <span class="date 1800">20 June</span> Soane recorded that he "went by Hackney carriage to the <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> at Kensington Palace," presumably to show him drawings for a new building, and "returned to the Tavern in his coach." We also know that on <span class="date 1800">17 May 1816</span> Soane showed to the <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> four drawings for a new Masonic Hall.</p>

                <p> In fact, no new chamber was built for twelve years, despite the pressing need for increased accommodation following the Union of the two grand lodges in <span class="date 1800">1813</span>. Instead, Soane carried out repairs and alterations to the existing buildings in <span class="date 1800">1816</span>. In <span class="date 1800">1821</span> he turned his attention to Sandby's Great Hall, taking plans to the <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> for his approval on <span class="date 1800">19 October</span>. Soane remodeled the gallery and arcades and also moved the organ. Fifteen years earlier, he had begun his preparation for his role as professor of architecture at the Royal Academy by making copies of the six lectures which had been delivered by Sandby, his revered predecessor as professor. Soane would have felt an appropriateness in following Sandby, first by becoming a Freemason and later by making alterations to Sandby's Great Hall. </p>

                <h3>The new Masonic Hall</h3>
                <p> In <span class="date 1800">1826</span> Soane began to prepare further designs for the Masonic Hall which had been envisaged as early as <span class="date 1800">1814</span> on property on <span class="place">Great Queen Street</span>, bought in <span class="date 1800">1815</span> on recommendation. The four designs which he had made <span class="date 1800">1816</span> are now lost, but we have four plans by him for the chamber, date eightd <span class="date 1800">16 April</span> and <span class="date 1800">27 May 1826</span>. The drawings are bizarre geometrical exercises in H and T plan forms, including one for a tripartite hall, comprising three spaces of contrasting shapes: at the south, a rectangle curved apsidal ends; a domed square in the center; and, at north, a rectangular space with space with canted ends.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Following a two-year delay, he drew up further plans in <span class="date 1800">1828</span>, many of them date eightd from the office which he maintained at <span class="place">Chelsea Hospital</span> in his capacity as Clerk of the Works. By this time the idea of a single large room, whether of tripartite or bipartite form, had been abandoned in favor of a smaller Masonic Hall with a separate room at right angles to it on the south side. The hall formed the upper part of a substantial new building with a kitchen and scullery on the ground floor and a new staircase on the west side. The hall was 45 feet by 35 feet, with a recess nearly four feet deep for an organ on the west side. The room to its south, with three south-facing windows, was 32 feet 10 inches by 17 feet 6 inches. Soane's initial ideas for the hall are revealed in one of the most extraordinary designs of his whole career, inscribed in his hand as "Exhibited as a general idea to HRH the <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> at Kensington Palace June 1828" [Figure 7]. It is for a neo-Tudor interior in an unmistakably Soanean manner, boasting a roof of notched timber beams surmounted by groin vaults and shallow domes, and lit with mullioned windows containing diamond-paned glass. The walls are lined with the kind of simplified linenfold paneling which featured in Soane's Law Courts at Westminster Hall of <span class="date 1800">1822-25</span>. The room thus belongs to that late phase in his career when he seemed to be moving toward a style that was a synthesis of classical and Gothic appropriate to historic or national institutions.</p>
                <figure class="fi">
                    <img src="https://github.com/giorgiacrosilla/cacty/blob/main/imgs/f12.png?raw=true"

                </figure>
                <p> The Tudor flavor was largely dropped in the executed design, which was, nonetheless, one the most personal and richly ornamented interiors of his career. The handsome new kitchen [Figures 8-9] which supported the hall had arcaded side walls of contrasting design and a timber-trussed roof, strikingly exposed, of a Palladian type first introduced to England by <span class="person jones">Inigo Jones</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inigo_Jones" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a> and <span class="person wren">Christopher Wren</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>. Soane was familiar with Jones's use of truss construction at the Banqueting House, for he rebuilt its ceiling in <span class="date 1800">1811</span>, incorporating iron tie rods. The drawings of Swiss timber bridges which he made for the Earl Bishop of Deny would also have been useful to him in this context. Soane chose a characteristically inward-looking way of hinting at the significance of his kitchen design, as well as its relation to that of the Masonic Hall above: this was to include a perspective view of it propped up as an exhibit in drawings by Gandy of the Masonic Hall itself. It may not be too far-fetched to see the progression from the timber trussing of the kitchen to the hovering canopy in the hall above as representing Masonic ritual ascent from manual labor to spiritual enlightenment. Soane's surviving drawings of <span class="date 1800">1828-29</span> for the Masonic Hall as executed record a familiar path in the designs of many classical architects from initial richness of ornament to comparative simplicity. Some early designs show the room articulated with the most sumptuous Corinthian order [Figure 10], instead of the Ionic eventually adopted, while others include pilasters crowded with rinceaux in a somewhat Adamesque style.</p>
                <p>The spandrels of the central, canopied dome are pierced by circular openings, like those in the breakfast room of John Soane's Museum [Figure 11]; and in others, the lantern above is ringed with miniature caryatids. What remained throughout was the basic, and highly unusual, disposition of the room [Figures 12-13]: the two sides featured end bays containing chimneypieces, with dows oddly placed over them; the centers of the long sides occupied by tripartite compositions, <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()"> rather like triumphal arches, </span> in which pedimented false door cases flanked arched and coffered recesses containing on the west side an organ and on the east side a ceremonial throne. The shorter north and south sides each received a similar tripartite treatment, with a throne in the center of the former and the main entrance in the center of the latter. Additional light filtered through four segmental clerestory windows, one high up in the center wall, and, more significantly, from the tall, glazed lantern> which surmounted the central hanging canopy.</p><p> As was customary with Soane's profoundly three-dimensional interior spaces, the vaulted ceiling provided the index of the whole design. The bays containing the windows and chimneypieces were linked across the room by broad segmental arches, ornamented with coffering. Here began the uncanny feeling which permeated the room: by inserting a window immediately over a chimneypiece <span class="person soane">Soane</span> reversed normal functional procedure, for the area devoted to the window was that customarily reserved for the flue. He further stressed the constructional daring by resting the coffered vaults not on walls but on the heads of the windows, thus suggesting that masonry was supported on glass. </p>

                <p>The most memorable feature of the room also challenged expectations of constructional propriety. This was the pendant dome in the form of an unsupported canopy, resembling Soane's favorite "sarcophagus lid" motif [Figure 14]. Silhouetted against the golden light filtering from the lantern this canopy would have hovered above the room "like a out-spread bat's wing.<sup>38</sup> Fortunately, we can appreciate highly unusual form of the lantern from the miniaturewhich Soane chose to reproduce in the dressing room in the Soane museum. From this we can see that, with its high, canted sides, it had a steep profile which is Gothic or Baroque in flavor, not classical.<sup>39</sup></p>

                <p> By this time in his career, colored light was central to <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> understanding of the effects which architecture should create. Thus the four side windows were glazed with richly colored and patterned glass, including a yellow diaper on an orange ground, while the compartments in the central lantern above the "sarcophagus lid" contained the signs of the zodiac in yellow ground glass alternating with rosettes [Figure 15]. The painted glass in the four clerestorey windows contained representations of five columns, a Masonic reference to the five orders of antiquity<sup>40</sup>. Columns lined up in this way were a familiar device on the craft certificates and invitation cards of eighteenth-century English lodges<sup>41</sup>. </p> <p>The image of constructional daring suggested by the central pendant dome or canopy was reinforced by heavy bronze chandeliers that Soane chose to hang from its four corners, ostensibly its weakest points. We know from the bill supplied on <span class="date 1800">2 January 1830</span> by <span class="person collins">William Collins</span>, Glass Enameller and Glass Manufacturer, that the chandeliers were, in fact, suspended by concealed iron rods which were covered with crimson cords and tassels<sup>42</sup>. Early drawings showed a more conventional arrangement by which the chandeliers were suspended from the ceiling beams<sup>43</sup>. Collins also supplied eight "japanned back lamps for lighting the dome" at a cost of £4, further heightening the ethereal atmosphere which evidently prevailed in the room at night.</p><p> This is the eerie mood which <span class="person gandy">Joseph Gandy</span><a

Its mood supports the suggestion that "there is an all-pervasive religiosity about masonic sociability...[in which] we may find that 'heavenly city' offered by the secular philosophies of the eighteenth century to their worldly and cosmopolitan followers.<sup>45</sup> <span class="person gandy">Gandy</span> shows us what resembles a stage scene, artificially lit and framed by a proscenium arch of curtains. Furniture is elaborately laid out but as yet unoccupied by the actors. At the far end is the ceremonial chair and pedestal for the Master of the Lodge, flanked by a chair on his left for the Immediate Past Master, and one on his right for a visiting dignitary. On the pedestal, which is a Masonic term for a small desk, the Bible, square, and compasses are placed at major ceremonies. This disposition is echoed in the foreground, where there is a ceremonial chair and pedestal for the Senior Warden, flanked by the Junior Deacon on his right and the Inner Guard on his left. Halfway down the righthand side a pedestal for the Secretary and Treasurer of the lodge, and chairs for the Senior Deacon and for the Master of Ceremonies and his ADC.<sup>46</sup> Beside each pedestal there is a candle stand, traditionally in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, representing the three lesser lights: the sun, moon, and Master of the Lodge.47 The three greater lights are the master and the two wardens. Near the center of the room is <span class="person soane">Soane's</span> ark. The careful attention which <span class="person soane">Soane</span> paid to the disposition of the furnishings is shown in a surviving plan [Figure 16] and a "perspective to show the arrangement of seats &c chairs, benches, throne [Figure 17].<sup>48</sup></p><p> There can be no doubt that in the Masonic Hall Soane intended to create, in classical terms, a daring and sublime Gothic aesthetic effect akin to the Tudoresque flavor of the design which he had presented to the <span class="person frederick">Duke of Sussex</span> in <span class="date 1800">June 1828</span>. The room, as executed, was a piece of speaking architecture, rich with symbolic and natural ornament as in Gothic churches. Its ornamental complexity helps explain why it took so long to complete: the foundation stone was laid in the <span class="date 1800">summer of 1828</span> but the room was not finally completed until early in <span class="date 1800">1831</span>. On a drawing of <span class="date 1800">10 August 1828</span>, Soane noted, "Motives of Ceremony Determined the height, in order to have the decoration complete as to character. It must be observed the great room is very much enriched."49 Bills from the plasterer, <span class="person palmer">Thomas Palmer</span>, for work carried out from June 1828 to March 1829, include references to classical ornaments such as "4 genii" and "Roman candelabra," but also to ornament based on English plants and trees such as thistle, shamrock, rose, oak</span>.50 On one of Soane's drawings for a wall elevation, an ornamental panel is inscribed as decorated with "bundles or rods and ribbons and oak leaves & shamrock twisted around them."<sup>51</sup> </p><p> In the portrait by <span class="person jackson">John Jackson</span><a

This painting is also of interest in showing the golden-brown coloring of the interior of the Masonic Hall: we know that the walls and vault were grained and varnished in a light oak color, while the pilasters of the door cases were painted in imitation of Siena marble. We can also see in Jackson's painting the glowing spots of color provided by the painted glass in the windows, which he shows as divided by a strong central mullion, providing a certain Tudor or seventeenth-century flavor.</p>

                <p> In <span class="date 1800">May and June 1829 </span> Soane spent much time working out designs for the decoration of the organ case.<sup>52</sup> These include a highly original wave border [Figure 18], which is probably a hermetic symbol of eternity, recalling the similar patterns which he included on theSoane Family Tomb in  <span class="date 1800">1816</span>. The organ is an important reminder of the role played by music in this interior, in which he gave a final, moving expression to his preoccupation with colored light, music, and poetic effects. The ambition of creating a unity of the arts was one he had found expressed in that key work by his fellow Freemasons, <span class="person mezieres">Nicolas Le Camus de Mezieres</span><a

The great Masonic Hall by <span class="person sandby">Sandby</span> was gaily, if incongruously, decorated with bunting, but also with drawings and designs by Soane, together with wreathed busts on circular pedestals of architects such as Michelangelo, Palladio, Jones, Wren, Taylor, Chambers, Adam, and Wyatt.
