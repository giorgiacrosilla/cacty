        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <div class="intro-container">
            <p>As articulated on the website's main page, the project's framework is guided by MMMM, aiming to explore
                three meticulously curated issues presented in a magazine-style layout. These issues delve into secret
                organizations, specifically examining KKK, Skull and Bones, and Freemasonry through scientific articles
                primarily sourced from Jstor. The magazine's objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of
                these organizations—unveiling their origins, founders, key figures, developmental areas, and principles.
            </p>
            <p>The website is structured into three principal sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Main Page: This serves as the project's entry point, orienting users to the overarching theme and
                    providing access to various articles.</li>
                <li>Documentation Page: This section likely serves as a repository for additional materials, supporting
                    a deeper exploration of the curated issues.</li>
                <li>Articles Page: Here, the main content unfolds. The text of each article is presented, accompanied by
                    accessible data and metadata. The articles have been meticulously tagged, enabling users to extract
                    information related to places, dates, people, and events. Checkboxes in the sidebar facilitate the
                    selection and display of specific data categories. Each article is linked to a dedicated map in the
                    sidebar, allowing users to visualize locations and identify text references.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The roles inside the group have been divided as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Giorgia Crosilla developed 90s and future dystopia styles and curated the KKK issue.
                </li>
                <li>Salvatore Di Marzo developed the Aldine and De Stjil styles and curated Skull and Bones issue.
                </li>
                <li>Nicole Liggeri developed the 70s and 1860 style and curated the Freemasonry issue. </li>

                    <h4>Visual References</h4>
                    <p>During the XVIth century one of the most popular type of print was the Aldine of the Aldine press of Aldus Manutius.
                        This success was due to the many innovations that this type of print possessed thanks to the ingenuity of Aldus Manutius: the use of a new type of typeface which was more compact and readable then the other Roman types and the size of the book which could be easily carried and read.
                        The prints all had the emblem of Manutius press, the dolphin and the anchor which made the print easily recognisable and promoted the brand.</p>

                    <h4>Layout</h4>
                    <p>
                        Taking the Aldine as the model we tried to best adapt it to a digital medium,
                        this was done by presenting the main page as an index of what can be seen inside of this project,
                        the navbar which is represented as the spine of a book, the use of justified text and of borders to separate the paragraphs when necessary.
                        The article page is presented as a single decorated page to allow for maximum readability and the idea of a transposed medium from print to digital.

                    <p>The font we used for this theme is the Flanker Griffo Italic which is heavily inspired by the typefaces degined by Francesco Da Bologna for Aldus Manutius,
                        the letters appear in high contrast with connections between the arms and ball terminals of the lowercase. 
                        To maintain high readability and keep a minimalistic style we decided to use a light grey background with dark ink.</p>

                <h2>1990s</h2>
                <h3>Cioè magazine</h3>
                <div class="cover-d" id="cioe"></div>
                <div class="first-d-paragraph" id="shape-right">
                    <h4>Visual References</h4>
                    <p>This style has been inspired by 1990s teenage magazines, in particular “Cioè”, a cult magazine
                        among Italian teenagers from the 80s to the early 00s. Defined by questionable design choices
                        and spontaneous shifts in fonts, colors, and layout within the same page, revisiting pages of
                        Cioè Magazine today evokes a mix of discomfort and nostalgia. In this style I have tried to take
                        elements from some covers of the magazine and internal pages to reconstruct the website at its
                        resemblance. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="second-d-paragraph">
                    <h4>Layout</h4>
                    <p>The cover page of the magazine serves as a visual anchor, introducing bidimensional irregular
                        shapes alongside photos. To echo this dynamic style, the main page of the website employs
                        diagonal lines, creating a sense of irregularity. A nod to the magazine's character is found in
                        the inclusion of little stars, reminiscent of the occasional decorative elements on certain
                        covers. <br>
                        The footer layout draws inspiration from the "about" section of the magazine, featuring a
                        slightly rounded box within the green section.
                        This design choice adds a touch of continuity and
                        familiarity. The cards, showcased with shadows, cleverly mirror the structure of the magazine's
                        logo, contributing to a cohesive and branded visual identity.<br>
                        On the documentation page, a repetition of images and irregular shapes runs along its length,
                        evoking the essence of both the cover page and select internal magazine layouts.<br>
                        Navigating to the articles page, a classic layout reminiscent of teenage magazines unfolds with
                        articles presented in three columns, each divided by a dotted line. Different borders are added
                        throughout the text, to resemble the choices made in the magazine. An activable sidebar on the
                        left introduces buttons slightly rotated, echoing the rectangular-shaped boxes often seen on the
                        covers of "Cioè" magazine.

                    <p>The creation of the palette started by extracting the three main colors of the cover magazine
                        represented in the figure, mainly aiming at defining the two colors used in the logo and
                        the green. Then I tried to develop a palette that mixed both cold and warm colors and that could
                        resemble as much as possible the colors used in the original magazine. </p>

                    <p>In the last two decades of the XX century, TrueType fonts emerged, designed to accommodate both
                        screen and print display needs. Notably, in 1982, Arial, a neo-grotesque font, was introduced to
                        meet the demands of laser printers, blending characteristics from Helvetica and Univers.
                        Meanwhile, classic typefaces like Helvetica continued to hold their ground, offering a timeless
                        and versatile aesthetic. The 1990s typography was characterized by a dynamic interplay of
                        traditional and contemporary fonts, reflecting the evolving technology and design preferences of
                        the time.
                        The website's font selection encompasses four typefaces, each serving a distinct purpose:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Lobster”: Chosen to replicate the italic font used in the original “Cioè” magazine's logo.
                        </li>
                        <li>“Telelower”: Originating from the font used by the Canadian cartoon channel “Teletoon” in
                            1997, it is employed for titles and subtitles to convey a sense of irregularity and fun,
                            aligning with the diverse font styles characteristic of the original magazine.</li>
                        <li>“Coolvetica”: A playful variant of Helvetica, created in the 1970s, introducing a funky and
                            dynamic element to the overall design.</li>
                        <li>"Helvetica": Despite Arial being emblematic during the last two decades of the XX century,
                            the decision to adhere to Helvetica was influenced by its historical use in the magazine,
                            alongside Helvetica Compressed. Additionally, Helvetica's compatibility with its derivative,
                            “Coolvetica,” offers flexibility and coherence in font combinations.

                <h3>Dystopian future</h3>

                        This style draws inspiration from George Orwell's "1984," envisioning a dystopian world
                        controlled by secret organizations. The overarching theme is retro-futurism, blending elements
                        from 1940s propaganda and particularly "1984-inspired" posters found online. The design aims to
                        create an unsettling atmosphere by merging past and future aesthetics.</p>

                    <h4>Layout</h4>
                    <p>The website layout is thought to evoke the surveillance themes portrayed in Orwell's "1984." The
                        left-positioned eye, reminiscent of "Big Brother," symbolizes continuous scrutiny, intensified
                        by rays signifying pervasive control—a motif shared with the illuminati and freemasonry's eye of
                        providence. The semicircular gradient background mirrors the circular shape of the eye,
                        complemented by logo images and the geometric cards in the footer, lend a more futuristic
                        touch.<br>
                        Text manipulations, including glitch and noise animations, along with deliberately broken text
                        elements, contribute to an unsettling and dystopian atmosphere. As for images, the presence of
                        noise and blurriness is mimicked. The simplicity of the articles page, featuring a single-column
                        layout for text and images, enhances readability.<br>
                        Censorship markings strategically cover phrases related to justice, equality, and freedom,
                        reinforcing the narrative of controlled information. The semicircular sidebar design, reflecting
                        the overarching circular motif, further underscores the pervasive influence present throughout
                        the website.

                    <h4>Font and color palette</h4>
                    <p>The chosen palette centers around two dominant colors: dark red and black, reminiscent of
                        propaganda posters and symbolic of authoritarian regimes. Red is also used as a representative
                        of blood, while grey, which are used for titles and paragraphs, contribute to the stark and
                        controlled aesthetic.</p>

                    <p>The chosen fonts for the website are reminiscent of propaganda typography, characterized by a
                        strong geometric design. "Redoctober" and "Rodchenko" (specifically, "Rodchenko
                        Light") draw inspiration from constructivist fonts found in Russian propaganda posters of the
                        1920s and 1930s. </p>
