                    A half-century ago, some historians connected Freemasonry with <span class="event american">American

                        link
                    </span></a>—were
                    Freemasons. <span class="person fay">Bernard Fay</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Fa%C3%BF" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>, a French historian who exposed Masons to the
                    Nazis in occupied <span class="place state">France</span> during World War II, made emphatic claims for
                    Freemasonry's importance to eighteenth-century revolutionary movements in France and the American
                    colonies. Fay saw Freemasonry as the "main instigator of the intellectual revolution" of that age
                    and "the spiritual father of its political revolutions." According to Fay, Freemasons engendered
                    among "a limited but very prominent class of people a feeling of American unity without which
                    American liberty could not have developed—without which there would have been no United States."<sup><a href="#f-one">1</a></sup>
                    Fay relied heavily on one Masonic writer in the United States, <span class="person morse">Sidney
                        Morse</span><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Edwards_Morse" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                            link
                        </span></a>, for his conclusions about Revolutionary America. Morse was convinced that "Masonry
                    brought together in secret and trustful conference the patriot leaders" who led their country in a
                    "fight for freedom." Morse saw Freemasons everywhere he looked: they sank the revenue schooner <span
                        class="place">Gaspee</span> in <span class="date 1700">1772</span>; they orchestrated the <span
                        class="event boston">Boston Tea Party</span> a year and a half later; and they dominated committees of
                    correspondence, committees of safety, provincial conventions, and the Continental Congress. Based
                    only on hearsay, Morse wrote that "<span class="person washington">Washington</span>, according to <span
                        class="person fayette">La Fayette</span><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Fayette_Grover" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                            link
                        </span></a>, it is said, never willingly gave independent command to
                    officers who were not Freemasons." Morse followed in the footsteps of other patriotic Masons. For
                    example, a zealous Masonic orator had eulogized Washington soon after his death:
                </p>
                <blockquote><span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()">A single institution [Masonry] brought men to the level of equality; he wished to understand its
                    principles, he wished to become one. its members. His soul have the pride to believe,
                    temple of and on the improvements its members. His soul expanded with the pure flame of charity;
                    and, I have the pride to believe, that, the first step which he made in the [Masonic] temple of
                    truth, had an influence on the fate of this empire, and on the improvements in the systems of other
                    governments.</span><sup><a href="#f-two">2</a></sup>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    For years Masonic writers repeated the sentiments expressed by Washington's enthusiastic Masonic
                    contemporary, albeit without any proof to substantiate their claims. Masonic lodges left skimpy
                    records, and Masons rarely mentioned such ties in their correspondence. More vexing still for the
                    historian, they virtually never linked their Masonic association to their political views. Forced
                    into performing logical and stylistic gymnastics as a result, one later Mason wrote, "What influence
                    Freemasonry may have had on the life and character of <span class="person franklin">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</span>
                    can only be conjecture, but that it did influence him and his contemporaries in the great struggle

                    Masonic writers themselves have become more circumspect. One succinctly stated, "all patriots were
                    not Freemasons and all Freemasons were not patriots." Another studied 241 "Founding Fathers" and
                    determined that only 68 were Masons, not all of them active members. Still another had been
                    reluctant to write a new biography of <span class="censorship" onmouseover="showAlert()">George Washington, since he knew that Washington was not very

                    The first official history of the Brotherhood was The Constitutions of the Free-Masons written by
                    <span class="person anderson">James Anderson</span><a

                    </span></a> took Anderson to task in his
                    multivolume work. Others have since done the same or deferred to Gould. Contrary to <span
                        class="person anderson">Anderson</span>, who carried Freemasonry back to antiquity, even linking it with
                    the biblical creation story, <span class="person gould">Gould</span> traced Freemasonry—as distinct from
                    stonemasonry—to the Middle Ages. Later writers have argued that Freemasonry only developed in the
                    seventeenth century, or even later, in Anderson's own lifetime. These newer Freemasons gradually
                    eclipsed older masonic craft guilds, which were absorbed into the new lodges or withered away and
                    disappeared. For Gould and those like him, that was the real history; what Anderson wrote was either
                    his own invention or based on legends, not empirical evidence.<sup><a href="#f-six">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even so, in the eighteenth century Anderson was widely respected. As an authoritative statement
                    about Masonic ideas, his Constitutions served as a handbook for Masonic lodges and members. If eighteenth-century Masons doubted the truth of
                    Anderson's genealogy, they still could have accepted Masonry as embodying universal truths that were
                    both logical and scientific. Anderson remains the best source for Masonic doctrine in Revolutionary
                    America.
                    <span class="person anderson">Anderson</span> characterized himself as the editor and collator of the
                    Constitutions, drawing his information from "ancient Records" and the "faithful traditions of many
                    Ages." He started the Masonic story with the 'Tear of the World," 4003 B.c., when God, Supreme
                    Architect of the Universe, created Adam in his own image. With Adam's expulsion from the Garden of
                    Eden the basic skills of Masonry—geometry and the "mechanical arts"—helped reduce humankind's
                    burdens. Adam passed along the craft to his progeny and "since the Fall, we find the Principles of
                    it in the Hearts of his Offspring." Old Testament prophets handed down Masonry from one generation
                    to the next. Through Abraham "God did wisely over-rule" his chosen people "in order to make them
                    good Masons before they possess'd the promis'd land." Under Moses, their "Grand Master," the
                    children of Israel rose as "a whole Kingdom of Masons" after fleeing Egypt. The architectural
                    culmination of their achievement came with Solomon's great temple in <span
                        class="place">Jerusalem</span>, which stood for over four hundred years. Some 183,600 masons
                    labored under Hiram Abif, "the most accomplish'd Mason upon earth."<sup><a href="#f-seven">7</a></sup>
                    According to Anderson the Israelites were ultimately defeated and scattered and Solomon's temple was
                    destroyed, but Masonry survived because it was "under the immediate Care and Direction of Heaven."
                    Masonry spread throughout the Mediterranean basin and into the hinterlands of <span
                        class="place state">northern Europe</span> and <span class="place state">India</span> as "this liberal Art"
                    was taught to "free born Sons of eminent Persons." In the British Isles the Angles and Saxons became
                    Christians and "free people" and began to restore the lost skills of Masonry. Prince Edwin, youngest
                    son of King Athelstan, formed the first grand lodge at <span class="place">York</span> in the tenth century</span>. English Masonry was strengthened with the arrival of
                    the Normans, who had preserved Masonic traditions in their culture. Britain thereafter rose to
                    greatness, marked by magnificent edifices that were Mason designed and built, including Westminster
                    Abbey and Saint Paul's Cathedral in <span class="place">London</span>.<sup><a href="#f-eigth">8</a></sup>
                    Anderson was a transplanted Scot who lived in London and rubbed shoulders with leading Freemasons of
                    his generation, including <span class="person frederick">Frederick, Prince of Wales</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a>. Anderson wrote
                    that Freemasonry had been embraced by the great men of history and was at heart moral and ethical.
                    Witness,

                <p>
                    <span class="person anderson">Anderson</span> advised, the Tower of Babel and Nebuchadnezzar's foolish
                    efforts to surpass the glory of Solomon's temple. As Anderson explained it, Freemasonry blended
                    mystical and rational, sacred history with the rise of Western civilization, and a message of
                    universal brotherhood with the growing grandeur of Britain.<sup><a href="#f-nine">9</a></sup>
                    Writers in the next generation of British Masons added to Anderson. Distinguishing between simple
                    masonry and the ideals of Freemasonry, one Mason wrote:
                </p>
                <p>
                <blockquote> Masonry passes and is understood under two denominations: it is operative and speculative. By the
                    former, we allude to the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure derives figure, strength,
                    and beauty, and whence results a due proportion and just correspondence in all its parts. By the
                    latter, we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain
                    secrecy, and practice charity.
                
                </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another eighteenth-century Masonic author explained that Masonry "never suffered the liberal arts
                    and sciences to be taught to any but the free-born." If later Masonic writers differed with Anderson
                    over some details, they still maintained his tone and linked Masonry with progress. One Mason rhapsodized, "In
                    the dark periods of antiquity, when literature was in a low state, and the rude manners of our
                    forefathers withheld from them the knowledge we now so amply share, Masonry began to diffuse
                    her influence." The result was beneficial to all: "The mysteries of this science unveiled, arts
                    instantly arose, civilization took place, and the progress of knowledge and philosophy gradually
                    dispelled the gloom of ignorance and barbarism." <sup><a href="#f-10">10</a></sup>
                    In colonial America, prospective Masons had to be nominated for membership, approved unanimously,
                    and, before being exposed to the rituals and secrets of the art, had to agree to abide by the
                    "Charges" set forth in Anderson's Constitutions. No Mason could be "a stupid Atheist,
                    nor an irreligious Libertine." All members had to be "good and true Men, free-born, and of mature
                    and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good report." Masons
                    were equal as brothers within the lodge, although "Masonry takes no Honour from a
                    Man that he had before." Those of a higher social station often held the most prestigious Masonic offices, but Masons were to promote charity for all. At the same time they
                    were "to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and true, before any other poor People in the
                    same Circumstances." They were not to discuss religion and politics in the lodge, and they were
                    expected to resolve disputes amicably, bringing suit in court only as a last
                    resort.<sup><a href="#f-11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Freemasonry was unable to stand above the din of the eighteenth century. Disharmony appeared within
                    Britain's Masonic ranks and led to the founding of a new set of lodges affiliated under a rival
                    grand lodge by <span class="date 1700">1751</span>. Those with deistic leanings preferred the 1723
                    edition of Anderson's Constitutions (Moderns), while those who were more orthodox Christians looked
                    to the 1738 edition (Ancients).Ancients were obliged to obey Christian precepts regardless of where
                    they lived; Moderns abided by the prevailing religious belief of their homeland. Apparently some who
                    became Ancients resented the power of London's grand lodge and looked to the older grand lodge in
                    York or others that had sprung up by the middle of the eighteenth century. They may have also
                    resented the domination of London and wanted to appeal more to the middle classes when recruiting
                    new members.<sup><a href="#f-12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whatever the cause of their differences, the rift between Ancients and Moderns in Britain was not
                    mended until <span class="date 1800">1813</span>. In retrospect the differences separating them
                    appear to have been minor. Disagreements were between individuals, not disputes over key principles.
                    Ancients and Moderns disagreed about the role of Masonry during antiquity—such as the relative
                    importance of Solomon's temple—but both sides claimed to go back to the beginning of time and
                    defined their raison d'etre as a quest to establish moral and ethical principles essential to human
                    happiness and social progress. Ancients were expected to abide by the same general code of conduct in promoting
                    virtue and combating vice as were Moderns. Every Mason, Ancient or Modern, was bound to practice
                    charity and to avoid any reference to politics or religion within the lodge. Their rituals may have
                    varied, but Ancients and Moderns passed members through the same three degrees of apprentice, fellow
                    craft, and master mason. They used the same organization of lodges linked together under a grand
                    lodge with masters, wardens, and other officers to preside over their affairs. They observed the
                    same ceremonial days, such as 24 June to celebrate John the Baptist as patron saint of masons, and 27 December to commemorate St. John the Evangelist.<sup><a href="#f-13">13</a></sup>
                    By the <span class="date 1700">1730s</span>, Masonic lodges affiliated with the grand lodge of London
                    had sprung up in <span class="place state">North America</span>. Lodges formed there received approval
                    from London after they had been organized, so they were more or less autonomous. Eventually the
                    Modern and Ancient dispute in Britain reached the colonies. For example, some Pennsylvania Moderns
                    turned to Ancient lodges, and Pennsylvania's Modern lodges had all but disappeared by the
                    Revolutionary War. The Ancient versus Modern struggle in <span class="place state">Pennsylvania</span>,
                    like that across the Atlantic, may have reflected class divisions, with ambitious mechanics and
                    farmers pitted against merchants and wealthier land
                    owners. However, this can be exaggerated since the divisions that split them did not carry over into
                    the Revolutionary crisis. Members of Ancient and Modern lodges in Pennsylvania were in both patriot
                    and Loyalist ranks.<sup><a href="#f-14">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The situation was different in <span class="place state">Massachusetts</span>, where Ancients were much
                    more likely than Moderns to be patriots. Boston provides the best example for claiming Freemasonry's
                    connection to the drive for independence. The Brotherhood made its formal Massachusetts debut on
                    <span class="date 1700">30 July 1733</span>, when a handful of Masons met at the Bunch of Grapes
                    tavern in <span class="place">Boston</span>. The acting grand master for New England, under a
                    warrant from the grand master of England, formed the grand lodge of St. John's. At least three
                    regular lodges took shape in Boston and over twenty were organized elsewhere in New England, all
                    nominally presided over by Boston's grand lodge of St. John.
                    <span class="person gridley">Jeremiah Gridley</span><a
                    href="hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Gridley" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">

                        class="date 1700">1761</span>, the Modern-Ancient rivalry spilled into Boston. That year a new
                    grand lodge of St. Andrew was formed in Boston under a commission from the grand master of Scottish
                    lodges with an Ancient tie. As far as members of St. Andrew's lodge were concerned this action was
                    no infringement on Gridley’s authority because his warrant came from London, not Edinburgh, and from
                    a grand master of Moderns, not Ancients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bostonians who founded St. Andrew's had been denied admission to St. John's or the lodges
                    affiliated with it. Nonetheless they extended their hands in a conciliatory gesture and wrote, "the
                    Lodge of St. Andrew being assembled for the purposes of promoting Brotherly Love and Unity have unanimously voted [for] a happy Coalition." St. John's responded that the Scottish grand master
                    had interfered where he did not belong. Some who had organized the new lodge were not accredited
                    Masons, and St. John's considered the new lodge "irregular." St. Andrew's retorted that St. John's
                    attitude was "subversive of the Principles of Masonry."<sup><a href="#f-15">15</a></sup>

                    Massachusetts since they were trying to work out their own problems and did not want to stir the
                    waters. Nor did Massachusetts Ancients and Moderns press matters. Although the rival lodges did not
                    merge until <span class="date 1700">1792</span>— twenty-one years before British Ancients and
                    Moderns would do the same—they settled into a relatively peaceful coexistence. Lodge members from
                    both sides even bought copies of Wellins Calcotf s Candid Disquisition, an updated version of

                    St. Andrew's lodge owned the Green Dragon tavern. "More Revolutionary eggs were hatched in this
                    dragon's nest," quipped Esther Forbes, "than in any other spot in Boston." The North End Caucus, led
                    by Warren, met there, as did the members of St. Andrew's. Some assert that the <span
                        class="event boston">Boston Tea Party</span> was planned at the Green Dragon and that the men behind it
                    were Freemasons. 'This Boston body, like most ancient lodges, was
                    dominated by men active in the revolutionary movement and had a more democratic membership than the
                    older lodge of Boston," proclaimed <span class="person cary">John Cary</span>, Warren's biographer.

                    The official meeting weis often preceded or followed by supper and refreshments. Gathering about the
                    fireplace in the long room, they lighted pipes and cemented the bonds of brotherhood with hot punch,
                    port, and madeira— It was here, more than in the meetings, that talk turned to politics, and to the
                    members of St. Andrew's such talk was congenial indeed.

                <p>
                    In tracing Revere's role in the Tea Party, Forbes made a similar
                    connection. She noted that Revere was active in the North End Caucus and St. Andrew's lodge and that
                    both groups were known to have had a hand dumping tea into Boston harbor.<sup><a href="#f-18">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Cary's and Forbes' sources were vague, they drew firm conclusions. Cary was convinced that
                    the "Liberty Party" in and around Boston that led the protest against imperial policy was linked to
                    St. Andrew's lodge: "The building of political sentiment among members of this powerful society was
                    the work of years and was closely associated with masonic social activities." According to Cary, St.
                    Andrew's deserved to be included on the same patriotic list as the North End Caucus, the Monday
                    Night Club, and the Sons of Liberty. Nevertheless, Cary also confessed that the "membership and
                    exact role of each of these groups is still obscure." Furthermore, Warren's personal life, including
                    his involvement in those groups and in political agitation before 1775, was difficult to reconstruct
                    because so little survived.<sup><a href="#f-19">19</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forbes' picture of Revere is also problematic. Forbes quoted from lodge minutes on the night of the
                    first tea ship's arrival, which stated only that those assembled "adjourned on account of few
                    Brothers present. Ν. B. Consignees of Tea took the Brethren's time." Records for the night of the
                    Tea Party itself are as terse: "Lodge closed on account of few members present." Forbes assumed the
                    importance of Freemasonry to Revere's politics and referred readers to an earlier biography that
                    emphasized Revere's joining and rise to grand master in <span class="date 1700">1794</span>, but
                    that study offered no insight as to why Revere became a Mason or what Masonic affiliation meant to
                    him.<sup><a href="#f-20">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps Cary and Forbes fell into the same inferential trap as Masonic enthusiasts like Sidney
                    Morse. They read too much into a spotty, fragmentary record. By contrast, historian <span
                        class="person labaree">Benjamin Labaree</span><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Woods_Labaree" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                            link
                        </span></a> was much more guarded in his later study of the Tea Party. He observed that many members of the Boston Committee
                    of Correspondence "also belonged to other groups—the North End Caucus, the Long Room Club, and the
                    Grand Lodge of Masons—which may have had a role in the planning as well." Reluctant to establish a
                    strong connection, Labaree qualified his conclusion.<sup><a href="#f-21">21</a></sup>
                    The evidence for Masonic involvement in the <span class="event boston">Boston Tea Party</span> and other
                    Revolutionary events is at best inconclusive. Although Morse believed that members of the Providence
                    Masonic lodge sank the Gaspee in June <span class="date 1700">1772</span>, he had no proof to
                    substantiate his assertion. Moreover, a once commonly held assumption that the Great Seal of the
                    United States reflects Masonic influence, particularly with its all-seeing eye suspended above an
                    incomplete pyramid, has now been challenged. According to the most exhaustive, painstaking account,
                    "it seems likely that the designers of the Great Seal and the Masons took their symbols from
                    parallel sources, and unlikely that seal designers consciously copied Masonic symbols with the
                    intention of incorporating Masonic symbolism into the national coat of arms."<sup><a href="#f-22">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neither did Freemasonry act as a unique unifying force. Massachusetts Ancients and Moderns finally
                    joined hands at the end of the Revolutionary era but a move during the Revolutionary War to combine
                    all Masons under George Washington as national grand master failed, never to be revived. To this day
                    Masonic lodges in the <span class="place state">United States</span>, with their three million or so
                    members—more than anywhere else in the world—are organized under state grand lodges, not a
                    centralized, national organization.<sup><a href="#f-23">23</a></sup>
                    It is doubtful whether Freemasons qua Freemasons played a significant role in the American
                    Revolution, even as their members joined the Revolutionary movement or stayed loyal to Britain.
                    Masonry as an institution did not figure in the eventual revolt; even so, the ideas and values of
                    Masons may have played a role, along with other beliefs that historians have traditionally linked to
                    the Revolutionary cause.
                    Instead of searching for something unique in Freemasonry or focusing on the peculiarities of Masonic
                    doctrine, it might prove more useful to see how certain aspects of Masonry reinforced attitudes that
                    were not peculiar to the Brotherhood. Masonry might have been distinctive, a society unto itself, but it was also part of Anglo-American culture. Perhaps Masonry contributed to the American
                    revolutionary impulse more indirectly. Masonry as an indirect influence offers a middle ground
                    between the extremes of claiming too much and ignoring the subject altogether. <sup><a href="#f-24">24</a></sup>

                    <p>
                    For example, <span class="person warren">Joseph Warren</span>, a leading Revolutionary and Mason, became a
                    Freemason in <span class="date 1700">1761</span> but was not very active until <span
                        class="date 1700">1765</span>. Warren's Masonic rise to lodge master in <span
                        class="date 1700">1768</span> and, a year later, to grand master of the Ancients paralleled his
                    politicization: he emerged simultaneously as spokesman for the "Liberty Party" decried by <span class="person">Francis Bernard</span> and <span class="person">Thomas Hutchinson</span>. Cary believed there was a connection, claiming that
                    Warren's "activities in this society were closely related to his political interests." Lodge records
                    are only comparatively full because the North End Caucus, Monday Night Club, and even the Boston
                    Sons of Liberty left virtually none. Lodge records say nothing about Revolutionary sympathies or
                    actions. Warren either never committed to paper his reasons for being a Mason or that personal
                    testament has not survived. In short, there is no traceable, direct connection between his Freemasonry and his Revolutionary politics. The same is
                    true of Otis and Revere.<sup><a href="#f-25">25</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    In Warren's case, an indirect approach yields more. In <span class="date 1700">1775</span>, Warren
                    was slain during the fighting on Breed's Hill and the British dumped his body into a simple grave
                    after the battle. Local patriots exhumed and reinterred the remains in <span
                        class="date 1700">1776</span>. <span class="person morton">Perez Morton</span><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perez_Morton" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                            link
                        </span></a>, master mason and
                    Warren's political ally from earlier years, delivered an address to mark the event. Morton lauded
                    Warren as a virtuous, "matchless Patriot" in his public life and as a 'Tattern for Mankind" in his
                    private affairs. "What a bright example he set [as grand master] to live within Compass, and act
                    upon the Square." Of all Warren's associations, Morton averred, "on none did he place so high a
                    Value" as Masonry. Morton did not state that Masonry was the source of Warren's patriotism or assert
                    that Masons had led the protest against imperial policy, much less that Masons had been behind the
                    Boston Tea Party or any other Revolutionary act.<sup><a href="#f-26">26</a></sup>
                    But Morton did link the virtues of Masonry with the virtues of the American cause. He felt that
                    Warren had been more noble in death than <span class="person wolfe">General James Wolfe</span><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wolfe" target="_blank"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">
                        link
                    </span></a> on the
                    Plains of Abraham in <span class="date 1700">1759</span> because Wolfe "died contending for a single Country" while Warren "fell to the Cause of Virtue and Mankind." By
                    paraphrasing Thomas Paine's Common Sense to make the war something more than a colonial revolt,
                    Morton implicitly tied Masonry and the American cause together. Morton implored his listeners that
                    only by fighting for their independence would they honor Warren's sacrifice and ensure that a
                    patriot's blood had not been shed in vain.<sup><a href="#f-27">27</a></sup>
                    A few months before his death, Warren delivered the fourth annual Boston Massacre oration and
                    proclaimed that "personal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property or an
                    exclusive right to dispose of what he has honestly acquired by his own labor, necessarily arises
                    therefrom, are truths which common sense has placed beyond the reach of contradiction." Dozens of
                    patriot orators who were not Masons ex pounded similarly. Yet perhaps Warren's Masonic tie, with its
                    emphasis on the right of freemen to associate voluntarily, strengthened his attachment to such
                    widely held notions.<sup><a href="#f-28">28</a></sup>
                    Masonry also could have helped convince Warren that the colonists were victims in a plot to
                    undermine their liberties. Like other patriots, Warren viewed British actions as conspiratorial as
                    well as tyrannical and thereby "repugnant to every principle of reason and natural justice." In
                    <span class="date 1700">1775</span>, he reiterated sentiments that he had expressed three years
                    previously in his first oration, when he had condemned "base" British "designs" and "repeated
                    attacks made upon our freedom." For Warren the Revolutionary American susceptibility to
                    conspiratorial fears may have been under scored by Masonic beliefs. In his eulogy Morton lamented
                    that it was Warren's fate, "like the great Master builder of the Temple of old, to fall by the Hands
                    of Ruffians, and be again raised in Honor and Authority." This was a veiled allusion to an essential
                    part of Masonic ritual: master masons were expected to be able to recite how Hiram Abif, master
                    mason of Solomon's temple, was murdered by three "ruffians"—who may have been unscrupulous
                    colleagues. They wanted to know Hiram's secrets and when he refused to tell them, they killed him
                    and hid the body. Hiram was soon discovered by his friends and reburied with great honor. Every time
                    Warren had passed through lodge rituals he heard this tale of a world filled with conspiracy and
                    corruption.<sup><a href="#f-29">29</a></sup>
                     Masons pledged to be dutiful citizens who would play no part in such evil doings. "A Mason is a
                    peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works," preached Anderson in his
                    Constitutions, "and is never to be concern'd in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare
                    of the Nation." Masons had been encouraged, even protected, by rulers over the centuries and they
                    owed fealty to their benefactors.
                    So that if a Brother should be a Rebel Against the State, he is not to be countenanc'd in his
                    Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an un happy Man; and if convicted of no other Crime, though
                    the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of
                    political Jealousy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and
                    his Relation to it remains indefeasible.<sup><a href="#f-30">30</a></sup>

                    Rebellion was hateful but, taken alone, it was not reason enough to expel a member. Masonic
                    commitment to virtue and benevolence, as well as to loyalty derived from comity and government based
                    on consent, could ultimately have pushed Warren and other Masons into rebellion.
                    Within Masonic lodges the leaders were expected to defer to majority will under the threat of
                    removal as were the grand lodge officers in their dealings with lodges under them. Masonic teaching
                    and protocol did not require unquestioning support of authority inside the lodge or out.
                    "Government, therefore, in some Form or other, must be the Will and Appointment of God," declared
                    one Mason in <span class="date 1700">1755</span>, so colonists should respect the British
                    constitution and the "just authority" of the king. "The Submission of Individuals must be a most
                    sacred Duty," yet good government "is founded on Consent, and a View to public Good." Resistance to
                    bad government was a last resort, but the "Doctrine of non-resistance is now sufficiently exploded,
                    and may it be eternally treated with that sovereign Contempt which it deserves among a wise and
                    virtuous people."<sup><a href="#f-31">31</a></sup>
                    Therefore, when American Revolutionaries eventually fought for independence after first rising to
                    defend their rights under the British constitution, it made perfect sense for Freemasons like Warren
                    to be among them. In choosing between loyalty to an empire that required subordination to the Crown and
                    Parliament, on the one hand, or a defense of political autonomy and natural rights, on the other,
                    Masonic doctrine may have helped simplify the choice. For Morton and Warren, Masonry may have
                    strengthened their attachment to a radical Whig political ideology laced with revolutionary
                    undertones. As Morton told his listeners, the American cause and patriotism—like Masonry—were
                    virtuous. Not surprisingly, by the war's end some patriotic Masons even strayed across the line that
                    kept the Brotherhood apolitical, as they linked national independence with the spread of Masonic
                    ideals.<sup><a href="#f-32">32</a></sup>
                    Not every Mason became a Revolutionary, and some became or remained Loyalists. Similarly, not every
                    Anglican espoused Loyalism, nor did every Congregationalist fight for independence. A simple
                    institutional explanation for political affiliation is not enough. Nevertheless, it is worth
                    considering how an institutional association might have affected individuals. Freemasonry appealed
                    to thousands of men in eighteenth-century America and thousands more in Britain. Those who became
                    Masons did so for a variety of reasons, including status enhancement, social mobility, camaraderie,
                    civic-mindedness, the satisfaction of mastering a ritual, or curiosity about the occult. Few Masons
                    recorded why they chose to join. That Freemasonry played a part, however indirectly and
                    inadvertently, in the coming of the American Revolution seems plausible. Among those who became
                    Revolutionaries, Masonry could have heightened their fear of a conspiracy against their liberties.
                    If the Revolutionary generation was concerned with the role of virtue in society, as recent
                    historians have stressed, Masonry could have deepened that concern, as well as a sense of community
                    responsibility and filial obligation among those who joined
                    and led the Revolutionary movement. At the same time, Masonry could also have pushed others into
                    Loyalism—men who had their sensibilities heightened by Masonic involvement but for their own reasons
                    chose the other side of the political contest.
                    Freemasonry should be included as a variation on the ideological and institutional themes that have
                    caught the attention of recent historians. Yet much remains unknown and unknowable. Historians are
                    obliged to draw inferences from incomplete records, a difficult task made even more difficult when
                    dealing with Freemasonry. Did those Masons who became Revolutionaries—or Loyalists—do so because
                    they were already inclined, before they entered the Brotherhood, to think and act a certain way? Or did their Masonic association accentuate tendencies that would otherwise have lain dormant?
                    Historians can infer and they can surmise, but they may not be able to explain fully the influence
                    of Freemasonry.
