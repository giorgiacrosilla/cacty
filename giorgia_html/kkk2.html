    <h1>The Ku Klux Klan: Continuity and Change<a href="#footnote-0">*</a> </h1>
    <p><span class="maiuscoletto">THE Ku KLUX KLAN</span> has seen as its mission the preservation of the
        institutionalized caste pattern of the South and the promotion of a
        patriotic ideology. Despite continuity in this mission and the preservation
        of elaborate rituals over the years, the Klan has undergone a change in
        its tactics and targets and can no longer be considered a viable social
        movement. <br>
        The history of the Klan falls into three periods. Following the <span class="event">Civil
            War</span>, the Klan was created to meet the threat posed by the newly freed
        slaves. Convinced that it had succeeded in preserving the antebellum
        South, the hooded knights vanished. Another war, the <span class="event">First World War</span>,
        brought the Ku Klux Klan back to deal with a host of changes in the
        "American Way," including <span class="event">immigration</span> of aliens to the United States
        and migration from the rural South to the Northern cities by black people. Combination of corruption within
        the organization and a feeling that some stability had been achieved in the society brought the "second
        Klan" abruptly to an end. The third period saw the resurrection of the
        Klan in response to the threat posed by the Supreme Court decisions of
        the fifties. A fragmented ghost of the past, the contemporary Ku Klux
        Klan continues to wage its fight against evildoers. <br>
        After examining the history of the Klan, two hypotheses emerge. The
        first is that although racism is the Klan's mainstay, the specific targets and tactics of its propaganda
        have varied, reflecting societal change. William Bruce Cameron, sociology professor at the University of South
        Florida, stated that the Ku Klux Klan is the classic example of a movement
        which has been reborn and that each rebirth has been marked by differences in purposes and in methods.<a
            href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> Mayer N. Zald and Robert Asch main-
        tain that changing conditions in the society increase or decrease the po-
        tential support base of a movement.<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Consequently, Klan tactics have
        been altered to maximize support and to ensure a large following without forsaking the Klan's mission.<br>
        The second hypothesis is that the Ku Klux Klan has changed in the
        hundred years of its existence from a social movement to a mentality. A movement denotes a large number of
        people banding together for the express purpose of changing individuals or societal institutions.<a
            href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> A klan
        mentality refers to an acceptance of
        what has been the Klan without identifying oneself with the Ku Klux Klan or
        without being aware that one's prejudices form the core of Klan thinking. not to say that the Klan created
        racism. Rather, it is to say that the ending of the Ku Klux Klan did not signal the end of racist
        thinking.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> This was
        true in the <span class="date 1900">thirties </span>and <span class="date 1900">forties</span>. Despite the collapse of
        the the subsiding of the post-World War I
        hysteria, the immigration based on Nordic supremacy remained.<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> Similarly, a more
        accurate
        ment of the contemporary Klan
        leads one to the conclusion that no longer an effective and viable force in American life, the klan mentality
        remains, if not thrives, today.<br>
        Besides the two theories which appear in this analysis, an examination will be made of the composition of
        the Klan, which has to tent varied depending upon the stated goals
        and the methods The question of what type of people belong to the Ku Klux Klan number of methodological problems
        that had to be faced. Those were strongly anti-Klan degraded Klansmen; an instance is <span class="author">Frederick
            Lewis Allen</span>'s statement that the Klan provided "a chance to dress village bigot and let him be a knight of
        the Invisible Empire."<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a> Members and friends of the Klan portrayed it as a fraternal
        organization of professional men,
        ministers, and civic leaders. To go beyond the statement that the truth lies in between these two
        descriptions becomes very difficult with a group that prides itself on secrecy. Government investigations,
        writings of ex-Klan members, and the few academic pieces on the subject appear at times to raise more questions
        than they have answered. Within this framework of
        frequently emotional writing and incomplete and often purposefully inaccurate statements, general conclusions,
        let
        alone specific postulates on Klan composition, become a challenge.

    <h3>The Reconstruction Klan</h3>
    <p>Klan organizations have consistently looked to the past and commemorated the achievements accomplished by their
        forerunners. Usually
        Klansmen trace their history to the time when a Confederate Army General, <span class="person">Nathan Bedford
            Forrest</span>, headed an
        organization called the Ku Klux
        Klan in nine Southern states.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> The idea for the name, the importance of sworn
        secrecy, and the use of bedsheets
        as a disguise came from activities of a handful of Confederate Army
        veterans in <span class="date 1800">1865</span> at <span class="place">Tennessee</span>. Since reportedly the purpose
        of these veterans was pure amusement, the Ku Klux
        Klan in the sense of a movement or organization began in <span class="date 1800">1867</span>. <br>
        Contrary to the legends which have persisted over the years, the Klan
        was relatively short-lived during <span class="event">Reconstruction</span>. It actually lasted as a
        formal organization only two years, until <span class="date 1800">1869</span>, when <span
            class="person">Forrest</span> disbanded
        it. As indicated in his testimony before the Joint Select Committee on the
        Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, he formed the
        Klan to deal with the animosity that existed between the Union and the
        rebel soldiers and the apprehension of violence from the newly freed
        slaves.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> The substitution of military governments for the locally created
        governments called for in the Reconstruction Act of March, <span class="date 1800">1867</span>, became
        the signal for the start of the Klan as an organization. The Klan became
        fairly successful in undermining the actions of the Radical Republicans
        in Congress by intimidating the freed slaves to keep them from voting. It
        was in their role as citizens that black men became the target of Klan
        vengeance. As history professor David Chalmers points out, the lack of
        overt militia violence on the part of the freed slaves suggests the conclusion that Klansmen were striking
        against the freed slaves as voters and
        officeholders and not as lawbreakers.<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a> The Klan struck against real or
        perceived resentment by the former slaves and quickly mobilized at the
        scattered signs of blacks achieving economic success.<br>
        The composition of the Klan changed quickly. Initially it was composed of the better citizens of the South. Soon
        it became popular among
        those elements in the former Confederate States whose status was less
        differentiated from the freed slaves- "the pore no'count white trash."
        Seeing his secret order becoming a salvage pile for the undesirable elements of society, <span
            class="person">Forrest</span> moved to
        disband it in <span class="date 1800">1869</span>. Despite the formal
        attempt to end the movement, nightriding Klansmen were active until
        <span class="date 1800">1877</span>. Several explanations have been given for the eventual decline of
        the Ku Klux Klan of the <span class="event">Reconstruction</span> period. Although public sentiment grew against
        its violence and federal
        legislation curbed its activities
        to some extent, the reason for the Klan's demise in <span class="date 1800">1877</span> is much simpler.
        The Klan for all intents had accomplished its purpose.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> President Rutherford B.
        Hayes in <span class="date 1800">1877</span> withdrew the last of the occupation armies. The
        government was again in the hands of native-born white Southern Democrats or Conservatives. The South saw the
        restoration of segregation-oriented governments and jim crow became the law of the land south of the
        Mason-Dixon line.</p>

            Club. In fact,
            it states the Ku Klux Klan, beginning with Forrest and until the present day United Klans,

    <h3>Knights of the Ku Klux Klan</h3>
    <p>In <span class="date 1900">1915</span>, the motion picture The Birth of a Nation convincingly rected the gallant and
        romantic image of the
        hooded knights the South. Based on Thomas Dixon's novel, The Clansmen, Birth had been shown to over a hundred
        million people who saw the Klan punish a mulatto who dared to win the love of Elsie Stoneman (played Lillian
        Gish).
        Despite protests from the National Association for vancement of Colored People, Harvard President Charles Eliot,
        Washington, Jane Addams, and others, the movie continued to primarily because it was at that time the best
        motion picture ever been made.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> Combining the talents of producer D. W. Griffith
        cameraman Billy Bitzer, this
        twelve reel movie introduced a number cinematic techniques. It also introduced phases such as "a single spring
        and the black claws of the beast sank into the soft white which appeared in The Clansmen.<a
            href="#footnote-12">[12]</a> Capitalizing on the
        movie's in Atlanta, <span class="person">William Joseph Simmons</span>, an ex-garter salesman and joiner of
        fraternal orders, chartered the
        Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in <span class="place">Georgia</span> on <span class="date 1900">December 6, 1915</span>.
        The Klan had begun its second phase. <br>
        <span class="person">Simmons</span>, as this century's first <span class="roles">Imperial Wizard</span>,
        expanded alistic elements of the Reconstruction Klan to create
        an autocratic hierarchy of officials, an elaborate ritual and a detailed array of regalia. The
        hierarchy listed such officers of the <span class="roles">klavern</span>(a local chapter) as the
        <span class="roles">kludd</span>(chaplain), <span class="roles">kligrapp</span>(secretary), <span
            class="roles">klaragoo</span>, <span class="roles">klexter</span>, and <span class="roles">nighthawk</span>
        (guards). Such an obsession with ritual and titles prompted the historian
        <span class="author">Richard Hofstadter</span> to note that the Klan set up a secret organization that
        in some ways flattered its opponents-e.g., the priestly garments of
        Roman Catholicism and the secret cells of the Communist Party.<a href="#footnote-13">[13]</a> All
        this ritual and use of impressive titles was not without purpose. The status-exalting nomenclature and rituals
        helped the Klansmen to set themselves apart from the mass of humanity and to become an indispensable
        part of the Invisible Empire. As one author suggested, "When a man joins
        the Ku Klux Klan, a sensation seems to come over him as definite as falling in love. He simply drops out of
        society and enters a new world."<a href="#footnote-14">[14]</a> <br>
        Despite this, the Klan had fewer than five thousand members when
        <span class="person">Simmons</span> turned to the services of professional publicists, Edward Young
        Clarke and Elizabeth Tyler, in <span class="date 1900">1920</span>. Thanks to the use of financial incentives to recruit new members, with
        Clarke's staff receiving 80 percent of
        the ten dollar initiation fee, membership climbed to 100,000 within sixteen months. Clarke's publicity got a
        healthy boost by an extensive series
        in the New York World in September of 1921 "exposing" Klan activities.
        Carried in eighteen newspapers mentioned throughout the press, the articles appeared to do more to arouse
        people's curiosity than their opposition.<a href="#footnote-15">[15]</a><br>
        Clearly the publicity and organizational experts had to have with existing prejudices. In order to create an
        organization with million members, according to some estimates, the Klan officials have capitalized on real
        fears. The years following <span class="event">World War</span> marked by an emotional letdown. The heightened patriotism that war brought
        continued after the Armistice. The War was followed hysteria that accompanied the <span class="event">Wall Street bombing</span> and the
        fear Bolsheviks. Coupled with these relatively distant concerns were real ones of <span class="event">migration</span>, primarily of
        Southern blacks to the urban of the North. The immigrants that had been coming to America posed a threat rather
        than a promise. Many Americans saw their life being changed. The League of Nations, "Negro upptiness,"
        cosmopolitanism, unhindered immigration all signaled the death of the old can way.<a
            href="#footnote-16">[16]</a> The Reconstruction Klan had
        responded to the perceived
        threat posed by the North and the freed slaves. Similarly, the Knights the Ku Klux Klan following <span
            class="event">World War I</span>
        responded to different reflecting the changes in the larger society. As the forces of change so did the Klan's
        reaction against them. It became anti-Catholic of Protestant, anti-alien instead of pro-American. The propaganda
        throughout the country-anti-Japanese in the Pacific states, anti-in the Atlanic states, and anti-Mexican in the
        Southwest. The fered a target for every frustration. <br>
        Clearly the Klan had as its targets imaginary as well as real For example, the state of <span
            class="place">Oregon</span> in <span class="date 1900">1922</span> had over
        25,000 Klan despite the fact that its population was 97 percent Caucasian, 85 native born American (balance from
        Canada), 92 percent Protestant, illiteracy was almost nonexistent. Nevertheless, by a combination lation,
        wartime tradition of suspicion and inquisitiveness, Prohibition,
        and superior salesmanship, a thriving Klan was created. The speed which the Klan took over the state is apparent
        in the statement Klan grew from nothing in <span class="date 1900">1921</span> to a force controlling <span class="place">Oregon</span>
        politics <span class="date 1900">1922</span>. By <span class="date 1900">1923</span> the Ku Klux
        Klan had elected both the President State Senate and the Speaker of the House.<a href="#footnote-17">[17]</a> At
        other times and the threats
        were much more real. In <span class="place">Chicago</span>, the Ku Klux Klan was strongest on the South Side,
        particularly in <span class="place">Kenwood</span>, <span class="place">Hyde Woodlawn</span>
        , <span class="place">South Shore</span>, and <span class="place">Englewood</span>. These areas of the city
        spond closely to the sections which felt the
        political pressure of the Roman Catholics and second generation immigrants, and the pressure exerted by the
        rapid influx of blacks into an ever-expanding Black Belt.<a href="#footnote-18">[18]</a> <br>
        As indicated above, <span class="author">Frederick Lewis Allen</span> equated Klansmen with
        the village bigot. Yet the Klan at this time thrived in the University of
        Chicago area of Hyde Park and klaverns were established at Harvard
        and Princeton.<a href="#footnote-19">[19]</a> To many native born Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and
        blacks posed more of a threat than did the Invisible Empire. A few non-
        random samples exist of the occupational background of the Klan in the
        1920's. The Knox County No. 14 in <span class="place">Knoxville, Tennessee</span>, in <span
            class="date 1900">1927</span> had 399
        members, of whom 29 percent were white-collar workers.<a href="#footnote-20">[20]</a> Tolerance, a
        magazine aimed at exposing the Klan, listed 110 members of the <span class="date 1900">1922</span>
        Chicago Klan, of whom 61 percent were white-collar workers. Despite
        the fact that the latter figures are biased toward the professionals since it
        was to the advantage of Tolerance to expose high status individuals, the
        Klan apparently had good representation of all segments of native born
        white Protestants. As to what social group formed the bulk of Klan mem-
        bership, <span class="author">Kenneth T. Jackson</span>, upon examination of the above data and
        analysis of similar statistics from <span class="place">Denver</span>, <span class="place">Indianapolis</span>,
        and <span class="place">Anaheim</span>,
        concludes "that in the city the secret order was a lower-class move-
        ment."<a href="#footnote-21">[21]</a><br>
        This leads to a second question concerning the composition of the
        Klan-was it a rural or an urban phenomenon? Mecklin concluded that:
        "The Klan is essentially a village and small-town organization. Neither
        the great city with its hodgepodge of races and groups nor the country
        with its isolation lends itself to effective Klan organization."<a href="#footnote-22">[22]</a> To say
        that an organization which resisted alien threats was more urban or rural
        is to maintain that one part of the nation had a monopoly on prejudice.
        The Invisible Empire although not strong everywhere attracted wide-
        spread support among farmers, townspeople, and city dwellers of many
        states. <br>
        Undoubtedly the most controversial aspect of the Ku Klux Klan is the
        tactics it employs. For the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the violent nightridings were only a small part. The
        boycotting of business-those which
        were Jewish-owned or those having some minimal type of integration
        among the employees or customers- was a frequently successful method
        for the Klan in achieving its goals. <span class="role">Imperial Wizard</span> <span class="person">Simmons</span> often used the phrase
        vocational Klanishness, which
        meant the "Trading, with and patronizing Klansmen in preference to all
        others." <a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>It was always to the benefit of the Klan to make it seem to those
        outside visible Empire that it was larger than
        it actually was. Parades, burnings, and other mass public demonstrations helped it to purpose. In <span
            class="date 1900">August of
            1925</span>, <span class="place">Washington</span> hosted a parade of tens sands of Klansmen that lasted
        three and a half hours. The publicity
        came out of such shows of strength aided the Klan as it drew icans into the Invisible Empire. <br>
        Violence as the collective activity of a local Klavern's members curred frequently in the <span class="date 1900">1920's</span>. For example,
        from <span class="date 1900">October, 1920, to October, 1921</span>, the Klan was implicated, although not
        necessarily in four killings, a mutilation,
        one branding with acid, five kidnappings,
        forty-two floggings, and twenty-seven tar and feather parties.<a href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>In looking at the
        role of violence, it is valuable to go
        beyond the initial ments made by those who opposed the Klan. Rather than being open-minded, opposition to the
        Klan in the 1920's was often only against its use of violence, with the opponents occasionally guage just as
        bigoted as the Klan. <span class="author">Fry</span> argued that "experience that the two races get along better when they are segregated,"
        he conceded the Klan should not bring this about. Rather, he said, come through an enlightenment of public
        opinion."<a href="#footnote-25">[25]</a> Similarly <span class="author">Bohn</span> in
        the American Journal of Sociology saw the Klan as cruel, but he also saw
        "barbaric and totally illiterate Negro slaves" coupled with immigrants
        who "have been invited to join us and hastily receive all the rights and
        privileges of citizenship" as posing real threats to America.<a href="#footnote-26">[26]</a> A former
        Klan member summarized this when he wrote that "much of the opposi-
        tion against the Klan was not so much based upon the Klan's activity
        against the Negro as it was against the Klan's assumption that it su-
        perseded the law."<a href="#footnote-27">[27]</a> <br>
        Another method used by the Klan of the 1920's was involvement in
        regular party politics. Never before and not since has the Ku Klux Klan
        been such a significant force in politics on all levels of government. As
        Klansmen or pro-Klan candidates got elected to governorships and even
        to the national Congress, the influence was bound to be felt at the na-
        tional level. It was felt, for example, at the <span class="date 1900">1924</span>Democratic Convention,
        which saw an anti-Klan plank defeated after a prolonged, heated debate.<a href="#footnote-28">[28]</a> But only
        four years later, the Democrats nominated <span class="person">Al Smith</span>. As Charles
        Alexander perceptively noted,
        "<span class="person">Al Smith</span>, son of Irish grants, represented everything the Klan, and
        perhaps most rural-Protestant Americans detested- New York City, Tammany Hall, Catholicism, foreignism."<a
            href="#footnote-29">[29]</a> Even
        though <span class="person">Smith</span> was defeated for the presidency, merely his nomination represented a
        significant political set-back for
        the Klan. When the contemporary Ku Klux Klan is discussed later in the paper, the involvement of Klansmen in
        local will be
        analyzed. In no respect does the group's current flirtation politics compare to the influence once wielded by
        the Knights. <br>
        There is little question that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan time were a powerul force which appeared to
        permeate every American life. One only has to turn to the Lynds' analysis of <span class="place">Muncie,
            Indiana</span>. They note that "one
        man who was divorced for 'non-stated privately that 'She and I split over the G- d- Klan. stand them around any
        longer.' "<a href="#footnote-30">[30]</a> Before too long, there appeared growing number of people who "couldn't
        stand them around any
        longer"

            Park, both of which experienced radical change in the twenties. Grand Boulevard "was the
            scene of conflict as efforts were made to keep new Negro families out of the district." De-
            spite these efforts, Grand Boulevard went from 32 percent black in 1920 to 94.6 percent black
            in 1930. Likewise, Washington Park went from 15 percent black in 1920 to 91.9 percent in
            1930. In both communities the black people displaced Jews of German descent who moved
            into Hyde Park. Consequently, Klansmen of Hyde Park saw an immediate threat from the
            Jews and a not too distant threat from the black people. Jackson discusses the involvement

    <h3>The Klan Fades Away for the Second Time</h3>
    <p>The 1930's brought new targets of Klan propaganda. It also ultimately
        brought the end of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Soon after election, a number of states adopted antimask
        laws in an effort Klan violence. However, two other reasons are more significant drop in membership internal
        struggles and the exposure of among top officials.<br>
        The Klan hierarchical structure dictated that Klansmen were their immediate leader and the other officials up
        the chain of They were to follow without question the decrees, commands, structions" that were given them.<a
            href="#footnote-31">[31]</a> With
        the prize huge amounts money in the form of initiation fees, dues, special assessments, backs from the
        production of robes, a number of power plays the organization that shook the very foundations of the movement.
        same time that internal dissension weakened the hierarchy, the pers regularly told of corruption and even
        immorality of certain leaders. The leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in <span
            class="place">Indiana</span>, <span class="person">Stephenson</span>, was
        convicted in <span class="date 1900">1926</span> of the murder and rape of girl.<a href="#footnote-32">[32]</a>
        Members of the Klan who by
        their oath were dedicated
        righteousness found this too difficult to accept and left the Empire. <br>
        In the midst of scandal and in-fighting, Indiana's <span class="person">James A. Colescott</span>
        became the Knights' third Imperial Wizard by replacing <span class="person">Evans</span> in
        <span class="date 1900">June of 1939</span>. Immediately the new aim of the organization became to
        "mop up the cesspools of communism in the United States."<a href="#footnote-33">[33]</a> Needless to say for the
        Klansmen communism was
        present in the NAACP Congress of Industrial Organizations, and was supported
        by money the Jewish community. For example, in <span class="place">South Carolina</span>, organizers the Textile Workers Union of America
        were fair game for Klansmen, and in neighboring <span class="place">Atlanta</span> thirty-two union leaders whipped. The underlying reason
        for the anti-unionism was equal pay concept behind union organizations. Consequently, would receive no more pay
        than a black member of the same the same work.<a href="#footnote-34">[34]</a> What might have been the high
        point in anti-Semitism was
        reached in <span class="date 1900">1940</span>, when the Knights became involved in the German-American Bund. In
        August of that burning
        Klansmen appeared side-by-side with swastika-bearing men at a rally on the 205-acre Camp Nordlund near <span
            class="place">Andover,
            New Jersey</span>. Despite the presence of the Imperial Wizard himself wedding at the rally, Colescott later
        attempted
        to
        repudiate amidst the unfavorable response it received.<a href="#footnote-35">[35]</a> <br>
        The organization known as the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,Inc. officially dissolved itself at an Imperial
        Klonvokation
        held in <span class="place">Atlanta</span> <span class="date 1900">April 23, 1944</span>. The immediate cause for its
        collapse was the suit for $685,305 in back taxes by
        the United States Bureau Revenue. The more significant cause was its inability to deal own success. If the Klan
        had grown more slowly and more cautiously, might have taken its place among other exclusive fraternities. it
        became subject to its own ineptness; and much like its Reconstruction
        ancestor, the Klan was undemocratic in organization and in decision-making, and uncontrollable in local action.
        The national leaders could not
        have controlled the violence and excesses in propaganda even if they had
        wished to.<a href="#footnote-36">[36]</a> <br>
        Despite the exposure of graft and the lack of a positive program, thousands of Americans clung to the Klan
        spirit; nevertheless, as a viable organization the Klan was dead. The few parades of hooded citizens of the
        Invisible Empire now held would bring jeers rather than cheers. Blacks,
        once afraid of these symbols of white supremacy, would line the parade
        route and shout, "Send us your sheets, white folks, we'll wash'em!"<a href="#footnote-37">[37]</a>
        Once a special order to which the politicians and businessmen flocked to
        gain dignity, it had become a pariah to be shunned by the same men. But
        though the prestige of the Klan was gone, the attitudes which formed its
        mentality were still very much alive.

    <h3>Fragments of the Klan</h3>
    <p>In <span class="date 1900">1946</span>, <span class="person">Samuel Green, Sr.</span>, an <span
            class="place">Atlanta</span> obstretrician, resurrected the old Association of Georgia Klans. Unwilling
        to recharter the Knights which he was a klavern head because of the
        back taxes due, he attempted
        to create a nationwide organization. By the time of his death three years later, it was clear that Green had
        failed
        miserably in this purpose. In <span class="date 1900">1953</span>, Eldon Lee Edwards chartered the US Klans of
        <span class="place">Georgia</span> in a attempt at Klan return
        of the post-war period. Despite his failure ganize outside the South, he and the Supreme Court decision on
        schools of <span class="date 1900">May, 1954</span>, laid the groundwork for the contemporary Klan. <br>
        Today's Ku Klux Klan is marked by fragmentation and the failure its leaders to agree on a common course of
        action in response to selected issues. In reality it is several organizations. The House Committee on
        Un-American Activities identifies fourteen separate groups ranging in membership from only 25 to over 15,000
        dues-paying Klansmen.<a href="#footnote-38">[38]</a>
        The Klan movement has been a victim of inter-group rivalry with always
        at least three groups competing for power since <span class="date 1900">1949</span>. Sometimes the dispute has been
        over tactics, such as the
        use of burning crosses to intimidate
        prospective black voters. More often it has appeared as simply a personality conflict or a struggle for control.
        Rather than examining all the various Klans, it is more fruitful to concentrate on the group with the largest
        following. <br>
        The largest contemporary Klan group is the United Klans of America
        (UKA) operating out of headquarters in <span class="place">Tuscaloosa, Alabama</span>, under the
        front of the "Alabama Rescue Service." Since <span class="date 1900">1961</span> its <span class="role">Imperial Wizard</span>
        has been <span class="person">Robert Shelton</span>, a former rubber plant worker, who holds this
        post despite his serving a sentence in Texarkana Prison for contempt of
        Congress before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<a href="#footnote-39">[39]</a> Very
        recently there have been significant signs that the UKA's hold on local
        klaverns has been weakening. The largest UKA following is in <span class="place">North
            Carolina</span>, where over half of the group's members reside. In <span class="date 1900">July of 1968</span>,
        reports began to filter out of <span class="place">North Carolina</span> that <span class="role">Grand
            Dragon</span> <span class="person">J. Robert
            Jones</span> was having difficulty keeping his klaverns in line. At that time the
        presence of Federal Bureau of Investigation informants was offered as
        the explanation for the unrest, but now it appears that policy differences
        were the reason. On <span class="date 1900">September 15, 1969</span>, a number of <span class="place">North Carolina</span>
        Klan leaders symbolically burned 125 membership cards on a cross.
        Claiming to represent half the state's membership, the leaders wished to
        break away from the UKA because of the overly centralized control of
        Klan operations. Leadership of the dissident group was to be offered to
        <span class="person">Jones</span> upon his release from prison in <span class="date 1900">January, 1970</span>, where
        he was serv-
        ing a term in a federal prison for contempt.<a href="#footnote-40">[40]</a> Despite this bitter dissension, the
        literature from the national
        office of the UKA as reflected in
        The Fiery Cross continued to declare, "When you're in <span class="place">North Carolina</span>
        . . .you're in 'Klan Country.'" <br>
        Once again one returns to the question of why people belong to the
        Klan. Clearly a major reason is racism. There appears to be no question
        of this in light of such qualifiers as "We don't hate Negroes. We love 'em
        in their place-like shinin' shoes, bell-hoppin', streetsweepin', pickin' cotton, diggin' ditches, eatin' possum,
        servin' time. ..."<a href="#footnote-41">[41]</a> An exalted cy-
        clops, the head of a klavern, summarizes the Klan's outlook, "Well, now,
        I'm not saying I approve of what was done there [the murder in <span class="place">Alabama</span>
        of a white civil rights worker, Viola Liuzzo], but you've gotta remember
        what she was doing. Anyway, let's face it-this is a war."<a href="#footnote-42">[42]</a> Frequently
        the sentiment is not so clearly directed. One Klan leader in 1958 justifying the activity of the Klansmen, a
        justification still used today, declared
        that "the Klan isn't anything except anti-devil."<a href="#footnote-43">[43]</a> Present-day Klan literature
        basically has three targets-
        blacks, Jews, and communists. Additional ones such as pacifists and civil rights workers are in the eyes of
        the Klan merely forms of one of these three evils. The New Left has replaced Roman Catholics and immigrants as
        threats to the Invisible Empire, largely because Catholics and newly arrived immigrants are less
        frightening to residents of <span class="place">Alabama</span>, <span class="place">Georgia</span>, <span
            class="place">Mississippi</span>, and the <span class="place">Carolinas</span> than civil rights workers. <br>
        The same controversy over the makeup of the Klan of the 1920's surrounds today's Ku Klux Klan. Richard Flowers,
        the Attorney General of
        Alabama, said "the average kluxer is a fifth-grade school dropout, with a
        background of social and economic failure."<a href="#footnote-44">[44]</a> At the same time a member
        of North Carolinas' State Bureau of Investigation said that respected
        "businessmen and professional people are reportedly supporting the
        Klan, financially and otherwise."<a href="#footnote-45">[45]</a> By examining present-day Klan members one sees
        virtually all facets of the
        white Protestant community represented. The study of Duke University sociologist <span class="author">Vander Zanden</span> found
        that two thirds of the Klansmen he studied were "on the lower rungs of
        the middle class- gas station owners, small garage owners, or were on
        the upper rungs of the working class-auto mechanics, etc."<a href="#footnote-46">[46]</a> To supplement and
        up-date <span class="author">Vander Zanden</span>'s data, an
        occupational-age-educational
        analysis was made of all the Klansmen called before the House Un-American Activities Committee in its 1965-1966
        hearings. There is admittedly the tendency for such a sample to be misrepresentative. The over-abundance of
        leaders rather than followers is indicated by the fact that 7 percent were full-time Klan employees. Table I,
        although offering no definite conclusion about the relative
        composition of the contemporary Ku Klux Klan, provides the latest information available on the range of people
        who belong. The data indicate the average Klansman is a forty-two year old skilled laborer with a high school
        education.

    <p>One of the important reasons for this type of person belonging to the
        Klan is the feeling of superiority that becoming a citizen of the Invisible
        Empire affords. This is now an even more important reason than earlier
        since many of the other reasons (e.g., the prestige that comes with belonging to the Klan) are absent. <span class="author">Vander
            Zanden</span>'s principal thesis is that
        Klansmen are men who have been generally thwarted from obtaining
        certain societal goals. Instead of blaming themselves they turn to scape-
        goats and speak of plots, conspiracy, and corruption. One writer says the
        typical Klansmen "feels trapped and sees no way out except by lashing
        out viciously at the Negro below him and the white power structure above him."<a href="#footnote-47">[47]</a>
        The regalia and emotional symbolism literally lift of the frustrating lives they lead. The
        transformation reaches of absurdity when Klansmen successfully recruit Catholics and grants on the pretext that
        they "will be accepted as members 'white' community and thus will enjoy all the benefits available
        thereof."<a href="#footnote-48">[48]</a><br>
        The methods used by the contemporary Ku Klux Klans are not
        greatly different from those used by the Knights in the <span class="date 1900">1920's</span>. Nightriding is still employed but is now more
        limited in its scope. A recent example of use of this tactic is the case of a movie theater in <span class="place">Gray, Georgia</span>,
        which permitted blacks to sit in the balcony. Every Friday night fifty
        carloads of robed Klansmen circled the theater, leading eventually to the
        closing of the movie house.<a href="#footnote-49">[49]</a> Political control is almost completely absent
        today; although Klansmen still run for office, they rarely get beyond the
        primary. In the one case in <span class="place">North Carolina</span> where Klansmen were elected
        in <span class="date 1900">1966</span>, they had been unopposed in both the primary and the election.
        Their affiliation with the Invisible Empire soon became an issue. The
        hollowness of this "Klan victory" was shown when the two men issued
        statements saying they would not let the Klan influence their jobs as
        sheriff and register of deeds.<a href="#footnote-50">[50]</a> It is only in a few scattered communities
        and counties that Klansmen can be said to exercise measurable influence
        over civic officials and law enforcement bodies. Lieutenant Governor
        <span class="author">Carroll Gartin</span> of <span class="place">Mississippi</span> put it succinctly when he said that "a politician could denounce the Klan in
        Mississippi and survive; it isn't that powerful."<a href="#footnote-51">[51]</a>
        Such a description certainly
        differs from the Klan of the when politicians routinely joined the Invisible Empire. <br>
        Violence appears still to be intimately related with this secret order.
        Much of the propaganda from contemporary Klan groups indicates a violent posture. In fact the rhetoric borders
        on a posture of peaceful existence with the enemy. A circular from the office of the <span class="role">Grand
            Dragon</span> of <span class="place">North Carolina</span> reads in part, "in the event of a riot or any
        type of civil strife please stay at home and protect your family and
        property .... Leave it to the local law enforcement officers, your state
        police, and the National Guard to put the trouble down, using lawful
        means." Yet there is no question that as individuals Klansmen tacitly ap-
        prove, if not engage in, many acts of violence. Amidst disavowals of
        his action by Klan officials, a Ku Klux Klansman was arrested for the at-
        tempted murder of <span class="place">Fayette, Mississippi</span>'s mayor, <span class="person">Charles Evers</span>.<a href="#footnote-52">[52]</a> Rallies
        featuring cross-burings arouse emotions sufficient to evoke an audience response of "Kill the Niggers!"<a
            href="#footnote-53">[53]</a> It is not surprising that racial in the South often follows a Klan rally. The
        Klan has formed which permitted members until recently to purchase ammunition guns at reduced rates. Such action
        groups as the Underground, Knock-off Squad, the Holy Terrors, the Wrecking Crew, and Squad are experts in
        demolitions and judo. Their determination olent tactics almost becomes an end in itself.<a
            href="#footnote-54">[54]</a> <br>
        Despite gains as a result of reaction to the <span class="date 1900">1960</span> lunch counter sit ins
        and the <span class="date 1900">1961</span> freedom buses, the Klan has never gone over 20,000 people
        in membership. One must be cautioned against undue optimism never-
        theless. The primary reason for the Klan's limited appeal to the masses
        lies in the formation of White Citizens Councils who focus their attention
        only on the blacks and who to some extent have shunned the extremist
        measures that have characterized the Klan even to the present.<a href="#footnote-55">[55]</a> It would
        appear then that little encouragement can be taken in the slow death of
        the Ku Klux Klan if it is paralleled by the rise of the White Citizens
        Council. </p>

    <h3>The Transformation of the Klan</h3>
    <p>The Ku Klux Klan throughout its history has retained its outwardly
        patriotic and ritualistic heritage. The Klan hierarchy of wizards, klea-
        gles, and nighthawks has remained the same whether the Invisible Empire has 5,000 or 5,000,000 members.
        Basically the Klan's strength has
        come from the feeling of uncertainty of certain members of American society when they see their life styles
        threatened.<br>
        Rather than confronting the change, the Klansmen have, whether in
        <span class="date 1800">1867</span> or <span class="date 1900">1967</span>, resisted the change and signaled out certain groups as the
        agents conspiring to undermine the American way. In the Reconstruction
        Klan the targets were the freed slaves and the North's occupation armies.
        As <span class="event">World War I</span> marked a watershed in the social history of the Republic,
        the scapegoat became the Roman Catholics and the Jews. With the ability to adapt in a macabre fashion, the
        Knights were quick to seize upon
        pacifists, Indians, Orientals, and a host of others as the perpetrators of
        everything bad. Today all the Klan's evildoers are still around- Jews,
        communists, and pacifists. Klansmen now cringe from the activities of
        civil rights workers, the mass media, and even the local tavern owner
        who allows "colored folk" in on weekday afternoons. This constantly
        changing target of Klan propaganda reflects the changing attitudes of
        American society. As Zald and Asch suggest, in order to maintain itself
        as a social movement, the Klan adapted to maintain a large following.
        But no longer can the Klan count five million in its Invisible Empire.
        The Realm's knights barely number enough to raise wooden crosses on
        isolated farms throughout the South and the Midwest. This suggests the second hypothesis, that the death of a
        social movement does not ily mean that its philosophies, or in this case
        prejudices, are not sent. One does not need to have a sheet over one's head to feel that evil-
        doers are at work everywhere. The white construction workers blocking
        the entry of blacks into trade unions, the White Hats of <span class="place">Cairo, Illinois</span>
        and similar vigilante groups, and the anti-sex education housewives are
        all Klansmen just as if they had ridden out of The Birth of a Nation. As movement the Klan may well be dead, but
        as a mentality it thrives.<br>
        One of the violent action groups with connections to the Klan is Nacirema or, ironically enough, American
        spelled backwards. There are many
        individuals, white and black, who still spell American backwards. Who
        can deny that much of the behavior one sees and reads about today
        epitomizes a klan mentality in all its hatred? </p>

    <p>(For the Flower People)<br>
        In the harlem of a rose<br>

        called tomorrow<br>

        trumpeting dilemma's horn<br>
        ride the heels of howling hounds<br>
        down the possum trail<br>
        into the marble garden<br>
        of forgotten names<br>

        through that crowded jail<br>
        of arrested blossoms.
